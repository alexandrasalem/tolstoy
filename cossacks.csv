i
all
is
quiet
in
moscow
the
squeak
of
wheels
is
seldom
heard
in
the
street
there
are
no
lights
left
in
the
windows
and
the
street
lamps
have
been
extinguished
only
the
sound
of
bells
borne
over
the
city
from
the
church
towers
suggests
the
approach
of
morning
the
streets
are
deserted
at
rare
intervals
a
sledge
kneads
up
the
snow
and
sand
in
the
street
as
the
driver
makes
his
way
to
another
corner
where
he
falls
asleep
while
waiting
for
a
fare
an
old
woman
passes
by
on
her
way
to
church
where
a
few
wax
candles
burn
with
a
red
light
reflected
on
the
gilt
mountings
of
the
icons
workmen
are
already
getting
up
after
the
long
winter
night
and
going
to
their
work
but
for
the
gentlefolk
it
is
still
evening
from
a
window
in
chevalier
restaurant
a
light
illegal
at
that
hour
is
still
to
be
seen
through
a
chink
in
the
shutter
at
the
entrance
a
carriage
a
sledge
and
a
cabman
sledge
stand
close
together
with
their
backs
to
the
curbstone
a
sledge
from
the
is
there
also
a
muffled
up
and
pinched
with
cold
is
sheltering
behind
the
corner
of
the
house
what
the
good
of
all
this
jawing
thinks
the
footman
who
sits
in
the
hall
weary
and
haggard
always
happens
when
i
on
duty
from
the
adjoining
room
are
heard
the
voices
of
three
young
men
sitting
there
at
a
table
on
which
are
wine
and
the
remains
of
supper
one
a
rather
plain
thin
neat
little
man
sits
looking
with
tired
kindly
eyes
at
his
friend
who
is
about
to
start
on
a
journey
another
a
tall
man
lies
on
a
sofa
beside
a
table
on
which
are
empty
bottles
and
plays
with
his
a
third
wearing
a
short
coat
is
pacing
up
and
down
the
room
stopping
now
and
then
to
crack
an
almond
between
his
strong
rather
thick
but
fingers
he
keeps
smiling
at
something
and
his
face
and
eyes
are
all
aglow
he
speaks
warmly
and
gesticulates
but
evidently
does
not
find
the
words
he
wants
and
those
that
occur
to
him
seem
to
him
inadequate
to
express
what
has
risen
to
his
heart
i
can
speak
out
fully
said
the
traveller
do
want
to
defend
myself
but
i
should
like
you
at
least
to
understand
me
as
i
understand
myself
and
not
look
at
the
matter
superficially
you
say
i
have
treated
her
badly
he
continued
addressing
the
man
with
the
kindly
eyes
who
was
watching
him
you
are
to
blame
said
the
latter
and
his
look
seemed
to
express
still
more
kindliness
and
weariness
know
why
you
say
that
rejoined
the
one
who
was
leaving
be
loved
is
in
your
opinion
as
great
a
happiness
as
to
love
and
if
a
man
obtains
it
it
is
enough
for
his
whole
life
quite
enough
my
dear
fellow
more
than
enough
confirmed
the
plain
little
man
opening
and
shutting
his
eyes
why
should
the
man
love
too
said
the
traveller
thoughtfully
looking
at
his
friend
with
something
like
pity
should
one
love
because
love
does
come
no
to
be
beloved
is
a
misfortune
it
is
a
misfortune
to
feel
guilty
because
you
do
not
give
something
you
can
not
give
o
my
god
he
added
with
a
gesture
of
his
arm
it
all
happened
reasonably
and
not
all
not
in
our
way
but
in
a
way
of
its
own
why
it
as
if
i
had
stolen
that
love
you
think
so
too
do
deny
it
you
must
think
so
but
will
you
believe
it
of
all
the
horrid
and
stupid
things
i
have
found
time
to
do
in
my
life
and
there
are
many
this
is
one
i
do
not
and
can
not
repent
of
neither
at
the
beginning
nor
afterwards
did
i
lie
to
myself
or
to
her
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
had
at
last
fallen
in
love
but
then
i
saw
that
it
was
an
involuntary
falsehood
and
that
that
was
not
the
way
to
love
and
i
could
not
go
on
but
she
did
am
i
to
blame
that
i
could
what
was
i
to
do
it
ended
now
said
his
friend
lighting
a
cigar
to
master
his
sleepiness
fact
is
that
you
have
not
yet
loved
and
do
not
know
what
love
is
the
man
in
the
coat
was
going
to
speak
again
and
put
his
hands
to
his
head
but
could
not
express
what
he
wanted
to
say
loved
yes
quite
true
i
never
have
but
after
all
i
have
within
me
a
desire
to
love
and
nothing
could
be
stronger
than
that
desire
but
then
again
does
such
love
exist
there
always
remains
something
incomplete
ah
well
what
the
use
of
talking
i
made
an
awful
mess
of
life
but
anyhow
it
all
over
now
you
are
quite
right
and
i
feel
that
i
am
beginning
a
new
life
you
will
again
make
a
mess
of
said
the
man
who
lay
on
the
sofa
playing
with
his
but
the
traveller
did
not
listen
to
him
am
sad
and
yet
glad
to
go
he
continued
i
am
sad
i
know
and
the
traveller
went
on
talking
about
himself
without
noticing
that
this
did
not
interest
the
others
as
much
as
it
did
him
a
man
is
never
such
an
egotist
as
at
moments
of
spiritual
ecstasy
at
such
times
it
seems
to
him
that
there
is
nothing
on
earth
more
splendid
and
interesting
than
himself
andreich
the
coachman
wo
wait
any
longer
said
a
young
serf
entering
the
room
in
a
sheepskin
coat
with
a
scarf
tied
round
his
head
horses
have
been
standing
since
twelve
and
it
now
four
dmitri
andreich
looked
at
his
serf
vanyusha
the
scarf
round
vanyusha
head
his
felt
boots
and
sleepy
face
seemed
to
be
calling
his
master
to
a
new
life
of
labour
hardship
and
activity
enough
said
he
feeling
for
the
unfastened
hook
and
eye
on
his
coat
in
spite
of
advice
to
mollify
the
coachman
by
another
tip
he
put
on
his
cap
and
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
the
friends
kissed
once
then
again
and
after
a
pause
a
third
time
the
man
in
the
coat
approached
the
table
and
emptied
a
champagne
glass
then
took
the
plain
little
man
hand
and
blushed
well
i
will
speak
out
all
the
same
i
must
and
will
be
frank
with
you
because
i
am
fond
of
you
of
course
you
love
her
i
always
thought
so
do
you
answered
his
friend
smiling
still
more
gently
perhaps
sir
i
have
orders
to
put
out
the
candles
said
the
sleepy
attendant
who
had
been
listening
to
the
last
part
of
the
conversation
and
wondering
why
gentlefolk
always
talk
about
one
and
the
same
thing
whom
shall
i
make
out
the
bill
to
you
sir
he
added
knowing
whom
to
address
and
turning
to
the
tall
man
me
replied
the
tall
man
much
rubles
the
tall
man
considered
for
a
moment
but
said
nothing
and
put
the
bill
in
his
pocket
the
other
two
continued
their
talk
you
are
a
capital
fellow
said
the
short
plain
man
with
the
mild
eyes
tears
filled
the
eyes
of
both
they
stepped
into
the
porch
by
the
by
said
the
traveller
turning
with
a
blush
to
the
tall
man
you
settle
chevalier
bill
and
write
and
let
me
know
right
all
right
said
the
tall
man
pulling
on
his
gloves
i
envy
you
he
added
quite
unexpectedly
when
they
were
out
in
the
porch
the
traveller
got
into
his
sledge
wrapped
his
coat
about
him
and
said
then
come
along
he
even
moved
a
little
to
make
room
in
the
sledge
for
the
man
who
said
he
envied
him
his
voice
trembled
mitya
i
hope
that
with
god
help
you
said
the
tall
one
but
his
wish
was
that
the
other
would
go
away
quickly
and
so
he
could
not
finish
the
sentence
they
were
silent
a
moment
then
someone
again
said
and
a
voice
cried
and
the
coachman
touched
up
the
horses
elisar
one
of
the
friends
called
out
and
the
other
coachman
and
the
began
moving
clicking
their
tongues
and
pulling
at
the
reins
then
the
stiffened
rolled
squeaking
over
the
frozen
snow
fine
fellow
that
olenin
said
one
of
the
friends
what
an
idea
to
go
to
the
caucasus
as
a
cadet
too
i
would
do
it
for
anything
are
you
dining
at
the
club
they
separated
the
traveller
felt
warm
his
fur
coat
seemed
too
hot
he
sat
on
the
bottom
of
the
sledge
and
unfastened
his
coat
and
the
three
shaggy
dragged
themselves
out
of
one
dark
street
into
another
past
houses
he
had
never
before
seen
it
seemed
to
olenin
that
only
travellers
starting
on
a
long
journey
went
through
those
streets
all
was
dark
and
silent
and
dull
around
him
but
his
soul
was
full
of
memories
love
regrets
and
a
pleasant
tearful
feeling
chapter
ii
fond
of
them
very
fond
fellows
fine
he
kept
repeating
and
felt
ready
to
cry
but
why
he
wanted
to
cry
who
were
the
fellows
he
was
so
fond
of
was
more
than
he
quite
knew
now
and
then
he
looked
round
at
some
house
and
wondered
why
it
was
so
curiously
built
sometimes
he
began
wondering
why
the
and
vanyusha
who
were
so
different
from
himself
sat
so
near
and
together
with
him
were
being
jerked
about
and
swayed
by
the
tugs
the
gave
at
the
frozen
traces
and
again
he
repeated
rate
very
fond
and
once
he
even
said
how
it
seizes
one
excellent
and
wondered
what
made
him
say
it
me
am
i
drunk
he
asked
himself
he
had
had
a
couple
of
bottles
of
wine
but
it
was
not
the
wine
alone
that
was
having
this
effect
on
olenin
he
remembered
all
the
words
of
friendship
heartily
bashfully
spontaneously
as
he
believed
addressed
to
him
on
his
departure
he
remembered
the
clasp
of
hands
glances
the
moments
of
silence
and
the
sound
of
a
voice
saying
mitya
when
he
was
already
in
the
sledge
he
remembered
his
own
deliberate
frankness
and
all
this
had
a
touching
significance
for
him
not
only
friends
and
relatives
not
only
people
who
had
been
indifferent
to
him
but
even
those
who
did
not
like
him
seemed
to
have
agreed
to
become
fonder
of
him
or
to
forgive
him
before
his
departure
as
people
do
before
confession
or
death
i
shall
not
return
from
the
caucasus
he
thought
and
he
felt
that
he
loved
his
friends
and
some
one
besides
he
was
sorry
for
himself
but
it
was
not
love
for
his
friends
that
so
stirred
and
uplifted
his
heart
that
he
could
not
repress
the
meaningless
words
that
seemed
to
rise
of
themselves
to
his
lips
nor
was
it
love
for
a
woman
he
had
never
yet
been
in
love
that
had
brought
on
this
mood
love
for
himself
love
full
of
hope
warm
young
love
for
all
that
was
good
in
his
own
soul
and
at
that
moment
it
seemed
to
him
that
there
was
nothing
but
good
in
it
compelled
him
to
weep
and
to
mutter
incoherent
words
olenin
was
a
youth
who
had
never
completed
his
university
course
never
served
anywhere
having
only
a
nominal
post
in
some
government
office
or
other
who
had
squandered
half
his
fortune
and
had
reached
the
age
of
without
having
done
anything
or
even
chosen
a
career
he
was
what
in
moscow
society
is
termed
un
jeune
homme
at
the
age
of
eighteen
he
was
free
as
only
rich
young
russians
in
the
who
had
lost
their
parents
at
an
early
age
could
be
neither
physical
nor
moral
fetters
of
any
kind
existed
for
him
he
could
do
as
he
liked
lacking
nothing
and
bound
by
nothing
neither
relatives
nor
fatherland
nor
religion
nor
wants
existed
for
him
he
believed
in
nothing
and
admitted
nothing
but
although
he
believed
in
nothing
he
was
not
a
morose
or
blase
young
man
nor
but
on
the
contrary
continually
let
himself
be
carried
away
he
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
love
yet
his
heart
always
overflowed
in
the
presence
of
any
young
and
attractive
woman
he
had
long
been
aware
that
honours
and
position
were
nonsense
yet
involuntarily
he
felt
pleased
when
at
a
ball
prince
sergius
came
up
and
spoke
to
him
affably
but
he
yielded
to
his
impulses
only
in
so
far
as
they
did
not
limit
his
freedom
as
soon
as
he
had
yielded
to
any
influence
and
became
conscious
of
its
leading
on
to
labour
and
struggle
he
instinctively
hastened
to
free
himself
from
the
feeling
or
activity
into
which
he
was
being
drawn
and
to
regain
his
freedom
in
this
way
he
experimented
with
the
civil
service
farming
music
to
which
at
one
time
he
intended
to
devote
his
life
and
even
with
the
love
of
women
in
which
he
did
not
believe
he
meditated
on
the
use
to
which
he
should
devote
that
power
of
youth
which
is
granted
to
man
only
once
in
a
lifetime
that
force
which
gives
a
man
the
power
of
making
himself
or
even
as
it
seemed
to
him
of
making
the
universe
into
anything
he
wishes
should
it
be
to
art
to
science
to
love
of
woman
or
to
practical
activities
it
is
true
that
some
people
are
devoid
of
this
impulse
and
on
entering
life
at
once
place
their
necks
under
the
first
yoke
that
offers
itself
and
honestly
labour
under
it
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
but
olenin
was
too
strongly
conscious
of
the
presence
of
that
god
of
youth
of
that
capacity
to
be
entirely
transformed
into
an
aspiration
or
idea
the
capacity
to
wish
and
to
do
to
throw
oneself
headlong
into
a
bottomless
abyss
without
knowing
why
or
wherefore
he
bore
this
consciousness
within
himself
was
proud
of
it
and
without
knowing
it
was
happy
in
that
consciousness
up
to
that
time
he
had
loved
only
himself
and
could
not
help
loving
himself
for
he
expected
nothing
but
good
of
himself
and
had
not
yet
had
time
to
be
disillusioned
on
leaving
moscow
he
was
in
that
happy
state
of
mind
in
which
a
young
man
conscious
of
past
mistakes
suddenly
says
to
himself
was
not
the
real
thing
all
that
had
gone
before
was
accidental
and
unimportant
till
then
he
had
not
really
tried
to
live
but
now
with
his
departure
from
moscow
a
new
life
was
beginning
a
life
in
which
there
would
be
no
mistakes
no
remorse
and
certainly
nothing
but
happiness
it
is
always
the
case
on
a
long
journey
that
till
the
first
two
or
three
stages
have
been
passed
imagination
continues
to
dwell
on
the
place
left
behind
but
with
the
first
morning
on
the
road
it
leaps
to
the
end
of
the
journey
and
there
begins
building
castles
in
the
air
so
it
happened
to
olenin
after
leaving
the
town
behind
he
gazed
at
the
snowy
fields
and
felt
glad
to
be
alone
in
their
midst
wrapping
himself
in
his
fur
coat
he
lay
at
the
bottom
of
the
sledge
became
tranquil
and
fell
into
a
doze
the
parting
with
his
friends
had
touched
him
deeply
and
memories
of
that
last
winter
spent
in
moscow
and
images
of
the
past
mingled
with
vague
thoughts
and
regrets
rose
unbidden
in
his
imagination
he
remembered
the
friend
who
had
seen
him
off
and
his
relations
with
the
girl
they
had
talked
about
the
girl
was
rich
how
could
he
love
her
knowing
that
she
loved
me
thought
he
and
evil
suspicions
crossed
his
mind
there
is
much
dishonesty
in
men
when
one
comes
to
reflect
then
he
was
confronted
by
the
question
but
really
how
is
it
i
have
never
been
in
love
every
one
tells
me
that
i
never
have
can
it
be
that
i
am
a
moral
monstrosity
and
he
began
to
recall
all
his
infatuations
he
recalled
his
entry
into
society
and
a
friend
sister
with
whom
he
spent
several
evenings
at
a
table
with
a
lamp
on
it
which
lit
up
her
slender
fingers
busy
with
needlework
and
the
lower
part
of
her
pretty
delicate
face
he
recalled
their
conversations
that
dragged
on
like
the
game
in
which
one
passes
on
a
stick
which
one
keeps
alight
as
long
as
possible
and
the
general
awkwardness
and
restraint
and
his
continual
feeling
of
rebellion
at
all
that
conventionality
some
voice
had
always
whispered
that
not
it
that
not
it
and
so
it
had
proved
then
he
remembered
a
ball
and
the
mazurka
he
danced
with
the
beautiful
d
how
much
in
love
i
was
that
night
and
how
happy
and
how
hurt
and
vexed
i
was
next
morning
when
i
woke
and
felt
myself
still
free
why
does
not
love
come
and
bind
me
hand
and
foot
thought
he
no
there
is
no
such
thing
as
love
that
neighbour
who
used
to
tell
me
as
she
told
dubrovin
and
the
marshal
that
she
loved
the
stars
was
not
it
either
and
now
his
farming
and
work
in
the
country
recurred
to
his
mind
and
in
those
recollections
also
there
was
nothing
to
dwell
on
with
pleasure
will
they
talk
long
of
my
departure
came
into
his
head
but
who
they
were
he
did
not
quite
know
next
came
a
thought
that
made
him
wince
and
mutter
incoherently
it
was
the
recollection
of
cappele
the
tailor
and
the
six
hundred
and
rubles
he
still
owed
him
and
he
recalled
the
words
in
which
he
had
begged
him
to
wait
another
year
and
the
look
of
perplexity
and
resignation
which
had
appeared
on
the
tailor
face
my
god
my
god
he
repeated
wincing
and
trying
to
drive
away
the
intolerable
thought
the
same
and
in
spite
of
everything
she
loved
me
thought
he
of
the
girl
they
had
talked
about
at
the
farewell
supper
had
i
married
her
i
should
not
now
be
owing
anything
and
as
it
is
i
am
in
debt
to
vasilyev
then
he
remembered
the
last
night
he
had
played
with
vasilyev
at
the
club
just
after
leaving
her
and
he
recalled
his
humiliating
requests
for
another
game
and
the
other
cold
refusal
year
economizing
and
they
will
all
be
paid
and
the
devil
take
them
but
despite
this
assurance
he
again
began
calculating
his
outstanding
debts
their
dates
and
when
he
could
hope
to
pay
them
off
i
owe
something
to
morell
as
well
as
to
chevalier
thought
he
recalling
the
night
when
he
had
run
up
so
large
a
debt
it
was
at
a
carousel
at
the
gipsies
arranged
by
some
fellows
from
petersburg
sashka
b
an
to
the
tsar
prince
d
and
that
pompous
old
is
it
those
gentlemen
are
so
thought
he
by
what
right
do
they
form
a
clique
to
which
they
think
others
must
be
highly
flattered
to
be
admitted
can
it
be
because
they
are
on
the
emperor
staff
why
it
awful
what
fools
and
scoundrels
they
consider
other
people
to
be
but
i
showed
them
that
i
at
any
rate
on
the
contrary
do
not
at
all
want
their
intimacy
all
the
same
i
fancy
andrew
the
steward
would
be
amazed
to
know
that
i
am
on
familiar
terms
with
a
man
like
sashka
b
a
colonel
and
an
to
the
tsar
yes
and
no
one
drank
more
than
i
did
that
evening
and
i
taught
the
gipsies
a
new
song
and
everyone
listened
to
it
though
i
have
done
many
foolish
things
all
the
same
i
am
a
very
good
fellow
thought
he
morning
found
him
at
the
third
he
drank
tea
and
himself
helped
vanyusha
to
move
his
bundles
and
trunks
and
sat
down
among
them
sensible
erect
and
precise
knowing
where
all
his
belongings
were
how
much
money
he
had
and
where
it
was
where
he
had
put
his
passport
and
the
requisition
and
papers
and
it
all
seemed
to
him
so
well
arranged
that
he
grew
quite
cheerful
and
the
long
journey
before
him
seemed
an
extended
all
that
morning
and
noon
he
was
deep
in
calculations
of
how
many
versts
he
had
travelled
how
many
remained
to
the
next
stage
how
many
to
the
next
town
to
the
place
where
he
would
dine
to
the
place
where
he
would
drink
tea
and
to
stavropol
and
what
fraction
of
the
whole
journey
was
already
accomplished
he
also
calculated
how
much
money
he
had
with
him
how
much
would
be
left
over
how
much
would
pay
off
all
his
debts
and
what
proportion
of
his
income
he
would
spend
each
month
towards
evening
after
tea
he
calculated
that
to
stavropol
there
still
remained
of
the
whole
journey
that
his
debts
would
require
seven
months
economy
and
of
his
whole
fortune
and
then
tranquillized
he
wrapped
himself
up
lay
down
in
the
sledge
and
again
dozed
off
his
imagination
was
now
turned
to
the
future
to
the
caucasus
all
his
dreams
of
the
future
were
mingled
with
pictures
of
circassian
women
mountains
precipices
terrible
torrents
and
perils
all
these
things
were
vague
and
dim
but
the
love
of
fame
and
the
danger
of
death
furnished
the
interest
of
that
future
now
with
unprecedented
courage
and
a
strength
that
amazed
everyone
he
slew
and
subdued
an
innumerable
host
of
hillsmen
now
he
was
himself
a
hillsman
and
with
them
was
maintaining
their
independence
against
the
russians
as
soon
as
he
pictured
anything
definite
familiar
moscow
figures
always
appeared
on
the
scene
sashka
b
with
the
russians
or
the
hillsmen
against
him
even
the
tailor
cappele
in
some
strange
way
takes
part
in
the
conqueror
triumph
amid
all
this
he
remembered
his
former
humiliations
weaknesses
and
mistakes
and
the
recollection
was
not
disagreeable
it
was
clear
that
there
among
the
mountains
waterfalls
fair
circassians
and
dangers
such
mistakes
could
not
recur
having
once
made
full
confession
to
himself
there
was
an
end
of
it
all
one
other
vision
the
sweetest
of
them
all
mingled
with
the
young
man
every
thought
of
the
future
the
vision
of
a
woman
and
there
among
the
mountains
she
appeared
to
his
imagination
as
a
circassian
slave
a
fine
figure
with
a
long
plait
of
hair
and
deep
submissive
eyes
he
pictured
a
lonely
hut
in
the
mountains
and
on
the
threshold
she
stands
awaiting
him
when
tired
and
covered
with
dust
blood
and
fame
he
returns
to
her
he
is
conscious
of
her
kisses
her
shoulders
her
sweet
voice
and
her
submissiveness
she
is
enchanting
but
uneducated
wild
and
rough
in
the
long
winter
evenings
he
begins
her
education
she
is
clever
and
gifted
and
quickly
acquires
all
the
knowledge
essential
why
not
she
can
quite
easily
learn
foreign
languages
read
the
french
masterpieces
and
understand
them
notre
dame

paris

sure
to
please
her
she
can
also
speak
french
in
a
she
can
show
more
innate
dignity
than
a
lady
of
the
highest
society
she
can
sing
simply
powerfully
and
passionately
what
nonsense
said
he
to
himself
but
here
they
reached
a
and
he
had
to
change
into
another
sledge
and
give
some
tips
but
his
fancy
again
began
searching
for
the
he
had
relinquished
and
again
fair
circassians
glory
and
his
return
to
russia
with
an
appointment
as
and
a
lovely
wife
rose
before
his
imagination
there
no
such
thing
as
love
said
he
to
himself
is
all
rubbish
but
the
six
hundred
and
rubles
and
the
conquered
land
that
will
bring
me
more
wealth
than
i
need
for
a
lifetime
it
will
not
be
right
though
to
keep
all
that
wealth
for
myself
i
shall
have
to
distribute
it
but
to
whom
well
six
hundred
and
rubles
to
cappele
and
then
we
see
quite
vague
visions
now
cloud
his
mind
and
only
vanyusha
voice
and
the
interrupted
motion
of
the
sledge
break
his
healthy
youthful
slumber
scarcely
conscious
he
changes
into
another
sledge
at
the
next
stage
and
continues
his
journey
next
morning
everything
goes
on
just
the
same
the
same
kind
of
and
the
same
moving
horses
cruppers
the
same
short
talks
with
vanyusha
the
same
vague
dreams
and
drowsiness
and
the
same
tired
healthy
youthful
sleep
at
night

central
russia
the
farther
he
left
his
memories
behind
and
the
nearer
he
drew
to
the
caucasus
the
lighter
his
heart
became
i
stay
away
for
good
and
never
return
to
show
myself
in
society
was
a
thought
that
sometimes
occurred
to
him
these
people
whom
i
see
here
are
not
people
none
of
them
know
me
and
none
of
them
can
ever
enter
the
moscow
society
i
was
in
or
find
out
about
my
past
and
no
one
in
that
society
will
ever
know
what
i
am
doing
living
among
these
people
and
quite
a
new
feeling
of
freedom
from
his
whole
past
came
over
him
among
the
rough
beings
he
met
on
the
road
whom
he
did
not
consider
to
be
people
in
the
sense
that
his
moscow
acquaintances
were
the
rougher
the
people
and
the
fewer
the
signs
of
civilization
the
freer
he
felt
stavropol
through
which
he
had
to
pass
irked
him
the
signboards
some
of
them
even
in
french
ladies
in
carriages
cabs
in
the
marketplace
and
a
gentleman
wearing
a
fur
cloak
and
tall
hat
who
was
walking
along
the
boulevard
and
staring
at
the
passersby
quite
upset
him
perhaps
these
people
know
some
of
my
acquaintances
he
thought
and
the
club
his
tailor
cards
society
came
back
to
his
mind
but
after
stavropol
everything
was
satisfactory
wild
and
also
beautiful
and
warlike
and
olenin
felt
happier
and
happier
all
the
cossacks
and
masters
seemed
to
him
simple
folk
with
whom
he
could
jest
and
converse
simply
without
having
to
consider
to
what
class
they
belonged
they
all
belonged
to
the
human
race
which
without
his
thinking
about
it
all
appeared
dear
to
olenin
and
they
all
treated
him
in
a
friendly
way
already
in
the
province
of
the
don
cossacks
his
sledge
had
been
exchanged
for
a
cart
and
beyond
stavropol
it
became
so
warm
that
olenin
travelled
without
wearing
his
fur
coat
it
was
already
spring
an
unexpected
joyous
spring
for
olenin
at
night
he
was
no
longer
allowed
to
leave
the
cossack
villages
and
they
said
it
was
dangerous
to
travel
in
the
evening
vanyusha
began
to
be
uneasy
and
they
carried
a
loaded
gun
in
the
cart
olenin
became
still
happier
at
one
of
the
the
told
of
a
terrible
murder
that
had
been
committed
recently
on
the
high
road
they
began
to
meet
armed
men
so
this
is
where
it
begins
thought
olenin
and
kept
expecting
to
see
the
snowy
mountains
of
which
mention
was
so
often
made
once
towards
evening
the
nogay
driver
pointed
with
his
whip
to
the
mountains
shrouded
in
clouds
olenin
looked
eagerly
but
it
was
dull
and
the
mountains
were
almost
hidden
by
the
clouds
olenin
made
out
something
grey
and
white
and
fleecy
but
try
as
he
would
he
could
find
nothing
beautiful
in
the
mountains
of
which
he
had
so
often
read
and
heard
the
mountains
and
the
clouds
appeared
to
him
quite
alike
and
he
thought
the
special
beauty
of
the
snow
peaks
of
which
he
had
so
often
been
told
was
as
much
an
invention
as
bach
music
and
the
love
of
women
in
which
he
did
not
believe
so
he
gave
up
looking
forward
to
seeing
the
mountains
but
early
next
morning
being
awakened
in
his
cart
by
the
freshness
of
the
air
he
glanced
carelessly
to
the
right
the
morning
was
perfectly
clear
suddenly
he
saw
about
twenty
paces
away
as
it
seemed
to
him
at
first
glance
pure
white
gigantic
masses
with
delicate
contours
the
distinct
fantastic
outlines
of
their
summits
showing
sharply
against
the
sky
when
he
had
realized
the
distance
between
himself
and
them
and
the
sky
and
the
whole
immensity
of
the
mountains
and
felt
the
infinitude
of
all
that
beauty
he
became
afraid
that
it
was
but
a
phantasm
or
a
dream
he
gave
himself
a
shake
to
rouse
himself
but
the
mountains
were
still
the
same
what
that
what
is
it
he
said
to
the
driver
why
the
mountains
answered
the
nogay
driver
with
indifference
and
i
too
have
been
looking
at
them
for
a
long
while
said
vanyusha
are
they
fine
they
wo
believe
it
at
home
the
quick
progress
of
the
cart
along
the
smooth
road
caused
the
mountains
to
appear
to
be
running
along
the
horizon
while
their
rosy
crests
glittered
in
the
light
of
the
rising
sun
at
first
olenin
was
only
astonished
at
the
sight
then
gladdened
by
it
but
later
on
gazing
more
and
more
intently
at
that
chain
that
seemed
to
rise
not
from
among
other
black
mountains
but
straight
out
of
the
plain
and
to
glide
away
into
the
distance
he
began
by
slow
degrees
to
be
penetrated
by
their
beauty
and
at
length
to
feel
the
mountains
from
that
moment
all
he
saw
all
he
thought
and
all
he
felt
acquired
for
him
a
new
character
sternly
majestic
like
the
mountains
all
his
moscow
reminiscences
shame
and
repentance
and
his
trivial
dreams
about
the
caucasus
vanished
and
did
not
return
it
has
begun
a
solemn
voice
seemed
to
say
to
him
the
road
and
the
terek
just
becoming
visible
in
the
distance
and
the
cossack
villages
and
the
people
all
no
longer
appeared
to
him
as
a
joke
he
looked
at
himself
or
vanyusha
and
again
thought
of
the
mountains
two
cossacks
ride
by
their
guns
in
their
cases
swinging
rhythmically
behind
their
backs
the
white
and
bay
legs
of
their
horses
mingling
confusedly
and
the
mountains
beyond
the
terek
rises
the
smoke
from
a
tartar
village
and
the
mountains
the
sun
has
risen
and
glitters
on
the
terek
now
visible
beyond
the
reeds
and
the
mountains
from
the
village
comes
a
tartar
wagon
and
women
beautiful
young
women
pass
by
and
the
mountains
canter
about
the
plain
and
here
am
i
driving
along
and
do
not
fear
them
i
have
a

and

the

still
retained

itself
by

a

creature

he
sees
a

in
the
hawkers
who
come
to
the
country
and
in
the

a

the
of
which

apostasy
the

upon
a
woman
as
an
instrument

old
age

demands
on
her
are
the

ones

consequence
of
this
outlook
women

give
the

all
the
more
power

importance
in
the
household
a
cossack
who
before
strangers
considers
it
improper
to
speak
affectionately
or
needlessly
to
his
wife
when
alone
with

is
involuntarily
conscious

superiority
his
house

all
his
property
in
fact
the
entire
homestead
has
been
acquired
and
is
kept
together
solely
by
her
labour
and
care
though
firmly
convinced
that
labour
is
degrading
to
a
cossack
and
is
only
proper
for
a
nogay
labourer

woman
he
is
vaguely
aware
of
the
fact
that
all
he
makes
use
of
and
calls
his
own
is
the
result
of
that
toil
and
that
it
is
in
the
power
of
the
woman
his
mother
or
his
wife
whom
he
considers
his
slave
to
deprive
him

all
he
possesses

the
continuous
performance
of

the

v
it
was
one
of
those
wonderful
evenings
that
occur
only
in
the
caucasus
the
sun
had
sunk
behind
the
mountains
but
it
was
still
light
the
evening
glow
had
spread
over
a
third
of
the
sky
and
against
its
brilliancy
the
dull
white
immensity
of
the
mountains
was
sharply
defined
the
air
was
rarefied
motionless
and
full
of
sound
the
shadow
of
the
mountains
reached
for
several
miles
over
the
steppe
the
steppe
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
and
the
roads
were
all
deserted
if
very
occasionally
mounted
men
appeared
the
cossacks
in
the
cordon
and
the
chechens
in
their
aouls
villages
watched
them
with
surprised
curiosity
and
tried
to
guess
who
those
questionable
men
could
be
at
nightfall
people
from
fear
of
one
another
flock
to
their
dwellings
and
only
birds
and

prowl

have
been

away
from
the

before
sunset
the
vineyards
like
all
the
surrounding
district
are
deserted
but
the
villages
become
very
animated
at
that
time
of
the
evening
from

sides
walking
riding

driving
in

they

with

from

buffaloes
disperse
at
a
run
all
over

cossack
women
in
coloured
beshmets
go
to
and
fro
among

you
can
hear
their
merry
laughter
and
shrieks
mingling
with
the
lowing
of
the
cattle
there
an
armed
and
mounted
cossack
on
leave
from

rides
up
to

knocks
in

to
the
knock
the
handsome
head
of
a
young
woman
appears
at
the
window
and
you
can
hear
caressing
laughing
voices
there
a
tattered
nogay
labourer
with
prominent
cheekbones
brings
a
load
of

steppes
turns

creaking
cart
into
the
cossack

lifts
the
yoke
off
the
oxen
that
stand
tossing
their

while
he
and
his
master
shout
to
one
another
in
tartar
past
a
puddle
that
reaches
nearly
across
the
street
a
barefooted
cossack
woman
with
a
bundle
of
firewood
on
her
back
makes
her
laborious
way
by
clinging
to
the
fences
holding
her
smock
high
and
exposing
her
white
legs
a
cossack
returning
from
shooting
calls
out
in
jest
it
higher
shameless
thing
and
points
his
gun
at
her
the
woman
lets
down
her
smock
and
drops
the
wood
an
old
cossack
returning
home
from
fishing
with
his
trousers
tucked
up
and
his
hairy
grey
chest
uncovered
has
a
net
across
his
shoulder
containing
silvery
fish
that
are
still
struggling
and
to
take
a
short
cut
climbs
over
his
neighbour
broken
fence
and
gives
a
tug
to
his
coat
which
has
caught
on
the
fence
there
a
woman
is
dragging
a
dry
branch
along
and
from
round
the

comes
the
sound
of

waits
for
the
cattle
which
her
daughter
maryanka
is
driving
along

she
has
had

fully
to
open

in
the

enormous
buffalo

maryanka
enters
at
the

and
throwing
away
her

slams
the

to

rushes
with
all
the

disappears
inside
the
shed
in
the
yard
following
the
big
fat
cattle
and
from
the

said
the
visitor
though
the
cornet
wife
had
known
all
this
long
ago
she
wanted
to
talk
about
her
lukashka
whom
she
had
lately
fitted
out
for
service
in
the
cossack
regiment

whom
she
wished

says

lukashka

quite
happy
he
says
well
thank

said
the
cornet
wife
snatcher
is
certainly
the
only
word
for
him
lukashka
was
surnamed
snatcher
because
of
his
bravery
in
snatching
a
boy
from
a
watery
grave
and
the
wife
alluded
to
this
wishing
in
her
turn
to
say
something
agreeable
to
lukashka
mother
thank

that
he
a
good

a
fine
fellow
everyone
praises

says
lukashka
mother
i
wish
is
to
get
him
married
then
i
could
die
in
peace
are
there
plenty
of
young
women
in
the
village
answered
the
cornet
wife
slyly
as
she
carefully
replaced
the
lid
of
the
matchbox
with
her
horny
hands
mother
plenty
remarked
lukashka
mother
shaking
her
head
your
girl
now
your
maryanka
that
the
sort
of
girl
have
to
search
through
the
whole
place
to
find
such
another
the
cornet
wife
knows
what
lukashka
mother
is
after
but
though
she
believes
him
to
be
a
good
cossack
she
hangs
back
first
because
she
is
a
cornet
wife
and
rich
while
lukashka
is
the
son
of
a
simple
cossack
and
fatherless
secondly
because
she
does
not
want
to
part
with
her
daughter
yet
but
chiefly
because
propriety
demands
it
when
maryanka
grows
up
she
be
marriageable
too
she
answers
soberly
and
modestly
send

matchmakers
to

i
send
them
only
let
me
get

lukashka
mother
we
make
our
bows
to
elias
vasilich
too
indeed
says
the
cornet
wife
proudly
to
me
you
must
speak

lukashka
mother
sees
by
the
stern
face
of
the
cornet
wife
that
it
is
not
the
time
to
say
anything
more
just
now
so
she
lights
her
rag
with

says

of
my
words
i

it

crosses

swinging

she
meets

who
bows
she
a

a
splendid

that

she
thinks
looking

her

any

it
time
she
was
married
and
to
a
good
home
married
to
lukashka
but
granny
ulitka
had
her
own
cares
and
she
remained
sitting
on
the
threshold
thinking
hard
about
something
till
the
girl
called
her
chapter
vi
the
male
population
of
the
village
spend
their
time
on
military
expeditions
and
in
the
cordon
or
their
posts
as
the
cossacks
say
towards
evening
that
same
lukashka
the
snatcher
about
whom
the
old
women
had
been
talking
was
standing
on
a
of
the
post
situated
on
the
very
banks
of
the
terek
leaning
on
the
railing
of
the
tower
and
screwing
up
his
eyes
he
looked
now
far
into
the
distance
beyond
the
terek
now
down
at
his
fellow
cossacks
and
occasionally
he
addressed
the
latter
the
sun
was
already
approaching
the
snowy
range
that
gleamed
white
above
the
fleecy
clouds
the
clouds
undulating
at
the
base
of
the
mountains
grew
darker
and
darker
the
clearness
of
evening
was
noticeable
in
the
air
a
sense
of
freshness
came
from
the
woods
though
round
the
post
it
was
still
hot
the
voices
of
the
talking
cossacks
vibrated
more
sonorously
than
before
the
moving
mass
of
the
terek
rapid
brown
waters
contrasted
more
vividly
with
its
motionless
banks
the
waters
were
beginning
to
subside
and
here
and
there
the
wet
sands
gleamed
drab
on
the
banks
and
in
the
shallows
the
other
side
of
the
river
just
opposite
the
cordon
was
deserted
only
an
immense
waste
of
reeds
stretched
far
away
to
the
very
foot
of
the
mountains
on
the
low
bank
a
little
to
one
side
could
be
seen
the
clay
houses
and
the
chimneys
of
a
chechen
village
the
sharp
eyes
of
the
cossack
who
stood
on
the
followed
through
the
evening
smoke
of
the
village
the
tiny
moving
figures
of
the
chechen
women
visible
in
the
distance
in
their
red
and
blue
garments
although
the
cossacks
expected
abreks
to
cross
over
and
attack
them
from
the
tartar
side
at
any
moment
especially
as
it
was
may
when
the
woods
by
the
terek
are
so
dense
that
it
is
difficult
to
pass
through
them
on
foot
and
the
river
is
shallow
enough
in
places
for
a
horseman
to
ford
it
and
despite
the
fact
that
a
couple
of
days
before
a
cossack
had
arrived
with
a
circular
from
the
commander
of
the
regiment
announcing
that
spies
had
reported
the
intention
of
a
party
of
some
eight
men
to
cross
the
terek
and
ordering
special
vigilance
no
special
vigilance
was
being
observed
in
the
cordon
the
cossacks
unarmed
and
with
their
horses
unsaddled
just
as
if
they
were
at
home
spent
their
time
some
in
fishing
some
in
drinking
and
some
in
hunting
only
the
horse
of
the
man
on
duty
was
saddled
and
with
its
feet
hobbled
was
moving
about
by
the
brambles
near
the
wood
and
only
the
sentinel
had
his
circassian
coat
on
and
carried
a
gun
and
sword
the
corporal
a
tall
thin
cossack
with
an
exceptionally
long
back
and
small
hands
and
feet
was
sitting
on
the
of
a
hut
with
his
beshmet
unbuttoned
on
his
face
was
the
lazy
bored
expression
of
a
superior
and
having
shut
his
eyes
he
dropped
his
head
upon
the
palm
first
of
one
hand
and
then
of
the
other
an
elderly
cossack
with
a
broad
beard
was
lying
in
his
shirt
girdled
with
a
black
strap
close
to
the
river
and
gazing
lazily
at
the
waves
of
the
terek
as
they
monotonously
foamed
and
swirled
others
also
overcome
by
the
heat
and
half
naked
were
rinsing
clothes
in
the
terek
plaiting
a
fishing
line
or
humming
tunes
as
they
lay
on
the
hot
sand
of
the
river
bank
one
cossack
with
a
thin
face
much
burnt
by
the
sun
lay
near
the
hut
evidently
dead
drunk
by
a
wall
which
though
it
had
been
in
shadow
some
two
hours
previously
was
now
exposed
to
the
sun
fierce
slanting
rays
lukashka
who
stood
on
the
was
a
tall
handsome
lad
about
twenty
years
old
and
very
like
his
mother
his
face
and
whole
build
in
spite
of
the
angularity
of
youth
indicated
great
strength
both
physical
and
moral
though
he
had
only
lately
joined
the
cossacks
at
the
front
it
was
evident
from
the
expression
of
his
face
and
the
calm
assurance
of
his
attitude
that
he
had
already
acquired
the
somewhat
proud
and
warlike
bearing
peculiar
to
cossacks
and
to
men
generally
who
continually
carry
arms
and
that
he
felt
he
was
a
cossack
and
fully
knew
his
own
value
his
ample
circassian
coat
was
torn
in
some
places
his
cap
was
on
the
back
of
his
head
chechen
fashion
and
his
leggings
had
slipped
below
his
knees
his
clothing
was
not
rich
but
he
wore
it
with
that
peculiar
cossack
foppishness
which
consists
in
imitating
the
chechen
brave
everything
on
a
real
brave
is
ample
ragged
and
neglected
only
his
weapons
are
costly
but
these
ragged
clothes
and
these
weapons
are
belted
and
worn
with
a
certain
air
and
matched
in
a
certain
manner
neither
of
which
can
be
acquired
by
everybody
and
which
at
once
strike
the
eye
of
a
cossack
or
a
hillsman
lukashka
had
this
resemblance
to
a
brave
with
his
hands
folded
under
his
sword
and
his
eyes
nearly
closed
he
kept
looking
at
the
distant
tartar
village
taken
separately
his
features
were
not
beautiful
but
anyone
who
saw
his
stately
carriage
and
his
intelligent
face
would
involuntarily
say
a
fine
fellow
at
the
women
what
a
lot
of
them
are
walking
about
in
the
village
said
he
in
a
sharp
voice
languidly
showing
his
brilliant
white
teeth
and
not
addressing
anyone
in
particular
nazarka
who
was
lying
below
immediately
lifted
his
head
and
remarked
must
be
going
for
water
one
scared
them
with
a
gun
said
lukashka
laughing
they
be
frightened
would
reach
mine
would
carry
beyond
just
wait
a
bit
and
when
their
feast
comes
round
i
go
and
visit
girey
khan
and
drink
buza
there
said
lukashka
angrily
swishing
away
the
mosquitoes
which
attached
themselves
to
him
a
rustling
in
the
thicket
drew
the
cossack
attention
a
pied
mongrel
searching
for
a
scent
and
violently
wagging
its
scantily
furred
tail
came
running
to
the
cordon
lukashka
recognized
the
dog
as
one
belonging
to
his
neighbour
uncle
eroshka
a
hunter
and
saw
following
it
through
the
thicket
the
approaching
figure
of
the
hunter
himself
uncle
eroshka
was
a
gigantic
cossack
with
a
broad
beard
and
such
broad
shoulders
and
chest
that
in
the
wood
where
there
was
no
one
to
compare
him
with
he
did
not
look
particularly
tall
so
well
proportioned
were
his
powerful
limbs
he
wore
a
tattered
coat
and
over
the
bands
with
which
his
legs
were
swathed
sandals
made
of
undressed
deer
hide
tied
on
with
strings
while
on
his
head
he
had
a
rough
little
white
cap
he
carried
over
one
shoulder
a
screen
to
hide
behind
when
shooting
pheasants
and
a
bag
containing
a
hen
for
luring
hawks
and
a
small
falcon
over
the
other
shoulder
attached
by
a
strap
was
a
wild
cat
he
had
killed
and
stuck
in
his
belt
behind
were
some
little
bags
containing
bullets
gunpowder
and
bread
a
horse

to
swish
away
the
mosquitoes
a
large
dagger
in
a
torn
scabbard
smeared
with
old
bloodstains
and
two
dead
pheasants
having
glanced
at
the
cordon
he
stopped
lyam
he
called
to
the
dog
in
such
a
ringing
bass
that
it
awoke
an
echo
far
away
in
the
wood
and
throwing
over
his
shoulder
his
big
gun
of
the
kind
the
cossacks
call
a
he
raised
his
cap
a
good
day
good
people
eh
he
said
addressing
the
cossacks
in
the
same
strong
and
cheerful
voice
quite
without
effort
but
as
loudly
as
if
he
were
shouting
to
someone
on
the
other
bank
of
the
river
yes
uncle
answered
from
all
sides
the
voices
of
the
young
cossacks
have
you
seen
tell
us
shouted
uncle
eroshka
wiping
the
sweat
from
his
broad
red
face
with
the
sleeve
of
his
coat
there
a
vulture
living
in
the
plane
tree
here
uncle
as
soon
as
night
comes
he
begins
hovering
round
said
nazarka
winking
and
jerking
his
shoulder
and
leg
come
said
the
old
man
incredulously
uncle
you
must
keep
watch
replied
nazarka
with
a
laugh
the
other
cossacks
began
laughing
the
wag
had
not
seen
any
vulture
at
all
but
it
had
long
been
the
custom
of
the
young
cossacks
in
the
cordon
to
tease
and
mislead
uncle
eroshka
every
time
he
came
to
them
you
fool
always
lying
exclaimed
lukashka
from
the
tower
to
nazarka
nazarka
was
immediately
silenced
must
be
watched

answered
the
old
man
to
the
great
delight
of
all
the
cossacks
have
you
seen
any
boars
for
boars

said
the
corporal
bending
forward
and
scratching
his
back
with
both
hands
very
pleased
at
the
chance
of
some
distraction
abreks
one
has
to
hunt
here
and
not
boars

he
added
needlessly
screwing
up
his
eyes
and
showing
his
white
teeth
said
the
old
man
i

he
added
and
are

going
to
watch
inquired
the
corporal
as
though
he
had
not
heard
what
the
other
said
did
mean
to
watch
tonight
replied
uncle
eroshka
with
god

holiday

hallo
uncle
called
out
lukashka
sharply
from
above
attracting
everybody
attention
all
the
cossacks
looked
up
at
him
go
to
the
upper
there
a
fine
herd
of
boars
there
i
not

cossacks

there
i
telling
you

truth
added
he
readjusting
the
musket
at
his
back
and
in
a
tone
that
showed
he
was
not
joking
lukashka
the
snatcher

said
the
old
man
looking
up

shooting

i
suppose
you
too
young
said
lukashka
by
the
ditch
he
went
on
seriously
with
a
shake
of
the
head
were
just
going
along
the
ditch
when
all
at
once
we
heard
something
crackling
but
my
gun
was
in
its
case

fired
suddenly
but
i

mosev
said
he
turning
resolutely
and
almost
commandingly
to
the
corporal
time
to
relieve
guard
and
holding
aloft
his
gun
he
began
to
descend
from
the
without
waiting
for
the
order
down
said
the
corporal
after
lukashka
had
started
and
glanced
round
it
your
turn
gurka
then
go
true
enough
your
lukashka
has
become
very
skilful
he
went
on
addressing
the
old
man
keeps
going
about
just
like
you
he
does
stay
at
home

the

had
already
set
and
the
shades
of
night
were
rapidly
spreading
from
the
edge
of
the
wood
the
cossacks
finished
their
task
round
the
cordon
and
gathered
in
the
hut
for
supper
only
the

still
stayed
under

watching
for

pulling

lukashka
singing
one
song
after
another
was
leisurely
placing
nets
among
the
very
thickest
brambles
to
trap
pheasants
in
spite
of
his
tall
stature
and
big
hands
every
kind
of
work
both
rough
and
delicate
prospered
under
lukashka
fingers
luke
came
nazarka
shrill
sharp
voice
calling
him
from
the
thicket
close
by
cossacks
have
gone
in
to
supper
nazarka
with
a
live
pheasant
under
his
arm
forced
his
way
through
the
brambles
and
emerged
on
the
footpath
said
lukashka
breaking
off
in
his
song
did
you
get
that
cock
pheasant
i
suppose
it
was
in
my
trap
nazarka
was
of
the
same
age
as
lukashka
and
had
also
only
been
at
the
front
since
the
previous
spring
he
was
plain
thin
and
puny
with
a
shrill
voice
that
rang
in
ears
they
were
neighbours
and
comrades
lukashka
was
sitting
on
the
grass
crosslegged
like
a
tartar
adjusting
his
nets
do
know
whose
it
was
yours
i
expect
it
beyond
the
pit
by
the
plane
tree
then
it
is
mine
i
set
the
nets
last
night
lukashka
rose
and
examined
the
captured
pheasant
after
stroking
the
dark
burnished
head
of
the
bird
which
rolled
its
eyes
and
stretched
out
its
neck
in
terror
lukashka
took
the
pheasant
in
his
hands
have
it
in
a
pilau
tonight
you
go
and
kill
and
pluck
it
shall
we
eat
it
ourselves
or
give
it
to
the
corporal
has
plenty
do
like
killing
them
said
nazarka
it
here
lukashka
drew
a
little
knife
from
under
his
dagger
and
gave
it
a
swift
jerk
the
bird
fluttered
but
before
it
could
spread
its
wings
the
bleeding
head
bent
and
quivered
how
one
should
do
it
said
lukashka
throwing
down
the
pheasant
will
make
a
fat
pilau
nazarka
shuddered
as
he
looked
at
the
bird
say
lukashka
that
fiend
will
be
sending
us
to
the
ambush
again
tonight
he
said
taking
up
the
bird
he
was
alluding
to
the
corporal
has
sent
fomushkin
to
get
wine
and
it
ought
to
be
his
turn
he
always
puts
it
on
us
lukashka
went
whistling
along
the
cordon
the
string
with
you
he
shouted
nazirka
obeyed
give
him
a
bit
of
my
mind
today
i
really
will
continued
nazarka
say
we
wo
go
we
tired
out
and
there
an
end
of
it
no
really
you
tell
him
he
listen
to
you
it
too
bad
along
with
you
what
a
thing
to
make
a
fuss
about
said
lukashka
evidently
thinking
of
something
else
bosh
if
he
made
us
turn
out
of
the
village
at
night
now
that
would
be
annoying
there
one
can
have
some
fun
but
here
what
is
there
it
all
one
whether
we
in
the
cordon
or
in
ambush
what
a
fellow
you
are
are
you
going
to
the
village
go
for
the
holidays
says
your
dunayka
is
carrying
on
with
fomushkin
said
nazarka
suddenly
let
her
go
to
the
devil
said
lukashka
showing
his
regular
white
teeth
though
he
did
not
laugh
if
i
could
find
another
says
he
went
to
her
house
her
husband
was
out
and
there
was
fomushkin
sitting
and
eating
pie
gurka
stopped
awhile
and
then
went
away
and
passing
by
the
window
he
heard
her
say
he
gone
the
fiend
why
do
you
eat
your
pie
my
own
you
need
go
home
for
the
night
she
says
and
gurka
under
the
window
says
to
himself
that
fine
making
it
up
quite
true
by
heaven
if
she
found
another
let
her
go
to
the
devil
said
lukashka
after
a
pause
no
lack
of
girls
and
i
was
sick
of
her
anyway
see
what
a
devil
you
are
said
nazarka
should
make
up
to
the
cornet
girl
maryanka
why
does
she
walk
out
with
any
one
lukashka
frowned
of
maryanka
they
all
alike
said
he
you
just
try
do
you
think
are
girls
so
scarce
in
the
village
and
lukashka
recommenced
whistling
and
went
along
the
cordon
pulling
leaves
and
branches
from
the
bushes
as
he
went
suddenly
catching
sight
of
a
smooth
sapling
he
drew
the
knife
from
the
handle
of
his
dagger
and
cut
it
down
a
ramrod
it
will
make
he
said
swinging
the
sapling
till
it
whistled
through
the
air
the
cossacks
were
sitting
round
a
low
tartar
table
on
the
earthen
floor
of
the
outer
room
of
the
hut
when
the
question
of
whose
turn
it
was
to
lie
in
ambush
was
raised
is
to
go
tonight
shouted
one
of
the
cossacks
through
the
open
door
to
the
corporal
in
the
next
room
is
to
go
the
corporal
shouted
back
burlak
has
been
and
fomushkin
too
said
he
not
quite
confidently
two
had
better
go
you
and
nazarka
he
went
on
addressing
lukashka
ergushov
must
go
too
surely
he
has
slept
it
off
do
sleep
it
off
yourself
so
why
should
he
said
nazarka
in
a
subdued
voice
the
cossacks
laughed
ergushov
was
the
cossack
who
had
been
lying
drunk
and
asleep
near
the
hut
he
had
only
that
moment
staggered
into
the
room
rubbing
his
eyes
lukashka
had
already
risen
and
was
getting
his
gun
ready
quick
and
go
finish
your
supper
and
go
said
the
corporal
and
without
waiting
for
an
expression
of
consent
he
shut
the
door
evidently
not
expecting
the
cossack
to
obey
course
thought
he
i
had
been
ordered
to
i
would
send
anyone
but
an
officer
might
turn
up
at
any
moment
as
it
is
they
say
eight
abreks
have
crossed
over
i
suppose
i
must
go
remarked
ergushov
the
regulation
ca
be
helped
the
times
are
such
i
say
we
must
go
meanwhile
lukashka
holding
a
big
piece
of
pheasant
to
his
mouth
with
both
hands
and
glancing
now
at
nazarka
now
at
ergushov
seemed
quite
indifferent
to
what
passed
and
only
laughed
at
them
both
before
the
cossacks
were
ready
to
go
into
ambush
uncle
eroshka
who
had
been
vainly
waiting
under
the
plane

till
night
fell
entered
the
dark
outer
room
lads
his
loud
bass
resounded
through
the
room
drowning
all
the
other
voices
going
with
you

for

for

chapter
viii
it
was
quite
dark
when
uncle
eroshka
and
the
three
cossacks
in
their
cloaks
and
shouldering
their
guns
left
the
cordon
and
went
towards
the
place
on
the
terek
where
they
were
to
lie
in
ambush
nazarka
did
not
want
to
go
at
all
but
lukashka
shouted
at
him
and
they
soon
started
after
they
had
gone
a
few
steps
in
silence
the
cossacks
turned
aside
from
the
ditch
and
went
along
a
path
almost
hidden
by
reeds
till
they
reached
the
river
on
its
bank
lay
a
thick
black
log
cast
up
by
the
water
the
reeds
around
it
had
been
recently
beaten
down
we
lie
here
asked
nazarka
not
answered
lukashka
down
here
and
i
be
back
in
a
minute
i
only
show
daddy
where
to
go
is
the
best
place
here
we
can
see
and
not
be
seen
said
ergushov
it
here
we
lie
it
a
place
nazarka
and
ergushov
spread
out
their
cloaks
and
settled
down
behind
the
log
while
lukashka
went
on
with
uncle
eroshka
not
far
from
here
daddy
said
lukashka
stepping
softly
in
front
of
the
old
man
show
you
where
they
been
i
the
only
one
that
knows
daddy
me
you
a
fine
fellow
a
regular
snatcher
replied
the
old
man
also
whispering
having
gone
a
few
steps
lukashka
stopped
stooped
down
over
a
puddle
and
whistled
where
they
come
to
drink
see
he
spoke
in
a
scarcely
audible
voice
pointing
to
fresh
bless
you
answered
the
old
man
boar
will
be
in
the
hollow
beyond
the
ditch
he
added
til
watch
and
you
can
go
lukashka
pulled
his
cloak
up
higher
and
walked
back
alone
throwing
swift
glances
now
to
the
left
at
the
wall
of
reeds
now
to
the
terek
rushing
by
below
the
bank
daresay
he
watching
or
creeping
along
somewhere
thought
he
of
a
possible
chechen
hillsman
suddenly
a
loud
rustling
and
a
splash
in
the
water
made
him
start
and
seize
his
musket
from
under
the
bank
a
boar
leapt
up
his
dark
outline
showing
for
a
moment
against
the
glassy
surface
of
the
water
and
then
disappearing
among
the
reeds
lukashka
pulled
out
his
gun
and
aimed
but
before
he
could
fire
the
boar
had
disappeared
in
the
thicket
lukashka
spat
with
vexation
and
went
on
on
approaching
the
ambuscade
he
halted
again
and
whistled
softly
his
whistle
was
answered
and
he
stepped
up
to
his
comrades
nazarka
all
curled
up
was
already
asleep
ergushov
sat
with
his
legs
crossed
and
moved
slightly
to
make
room
for
lukashka
jolly
it
is
to
sit
here
it
really
a
good
place
said
he
you
take
him
there
him
where
answered
lukashka
spreading
out
his
cloak
what
a
big
boar
i
roused
just
now
close
to
the
water
i
expect
it
was
the
very
one
you
must
have
heard
the
crash
did
hear
a
beast
crashing
through
i
knew
at
once
it
was
a
beast
i
thought
to
myself
lukashka
has
roused
a
beast
ergushov
said
wrapping
himself
up
in
his
cloak
i
go
to
sleep
he
added
me
when
the
cocks
crow
we
must
have
discipline
i
lie
down
and
have
a
nap
and
then
you
will
have
a
nap
and
i
watch
that
the
way
i
do
want
to
sleep
answered
lukashka
the
night
was
dark
warm
and
still
only
on
one
side
of
the
sky
the
stars
were
shining
the
other
and
greater
part
was
overcast
by
one
huge
cloud
stretching
from
the
mountaintops
the
black
cloud
blending
in
the
absence
of
any
wind
with
the
mountains
moved
slowly
onwards
its
curved
edges
sharply
denned
against
the
deep
starry
sky
only
in
front
of
him
could
the
cossack
discern
the
terek
and
the
distance
beyond
behind
and
on
both
sides
he
was
surrounded
by
a
wall
of
reeds
occasionally
the
reeds
would
sway
and
rustle
against
one
another
apparently
without
cause
seen
from
down
below
against
the
clear
part
of
the
sky
their
waving
tufts
looked
like
the
feathery
branches
of
trees
close
in
front
at
his
very
feet
was
the
bank
and
at
its
base
the
rushing
torrent
a
little
farther
on
was
the
moving
mass
of
glassy
brown
water
which
eddied
rhythmically
along
the
bank
and
round
the
shallows
farther
still
water
banks
and
cloud
all
merged
together
in
impenetrable
gloom
along
the
surface
of
the
water
floated
black
shadows
in
which
the
experienced
eyes
of
the
cossack
detected
trees
carried
down
by
the
current
only
very
rarely
mirrored
in
the
water
as
in
a
black
glass
disclosed
the
sloping
bank
opposite
the
rhythmic
sounds
of
night
the
rustling
of
the
reeds
the
snoring
of
the
cossacks
the
hum
of
mosquitoes
and
the
rushing
water
were
every
now
and
then
broken
by
a
shot
fired
in
the
distance
or
by
the
gurgling
of
water
when
a
piece
of
bank
slipped
down
the
splash
of
a
big
fish
or
the
crashing
of
an
animal
breaking
through
the
thick
undergrowth
in
the
wood
once
an
owl
flew
past
along
the
terek
flapping
one
wing
against
the
other
rhythmically
at
every
second
beat
just
above
the
cossack
head
it
turned
towards
the
wood
and
then
striking
its
wings
no
longer
after
every
other
flap
but
at
every
flap
it
flew
to
an
old
plane
tree
where
it
rustled
about
for
a
long
time
before
settling
down
among
the
branches
at
every
one
of
these
unexpected
sounds
the
watching
cossack
listened
intently
straining
his
hearing
and
screwing
up
his
eyes
while
he
deliberately
felt
for
his
musket
the
greater
part
of
the
night
was
past
the
black
cloud
that
had
moved
westward
revealed
the
clear
starry
sky
from
under
its
torn
edge
and
the
golden
upturned
crescent
of
the
moon
shone
above
the
mountains
with
a
reddish
light
the
cold
began
to
be
penetrating
nazarka
awoke
spoke
a
little
and
fell
asleep
again
lukashka
feeling
bored
got
up
drew
the
knife
from
his
and
began
to
fashion
his
stick
into
a
ramrod
his
head
was
full
of
the
chechens
who
lived
over
there
in
the
mountains
and
of
how
their
brave
lads
came
across
and
were
not
afraid
of
the
cossacks
and
might
even
now
be
crossing
the
river
at
some
other
spot
he
thrust
himself
out
of
his
and
looked
along
the
river
but
could
see
nothing
and
as
he
continued
looking
out
at
intervals
upon
the
river
and
at
the
opposite
bank
now
dimly
distinguishable
from
the
water
in
the
faint
moonlight
he
no
longer
thought
about
the
chechens
but
only
of
when
it
would
be
time
to
wake
his
comrades
and
of
going
home
to
the
village
in
the
village
he
imagined
dunayka
his
soul
as
the
cossacks
call
a
mistress
and
thought
of
her
with
vexation
silvery
mists
a
sign
of
coming
morning
glittered
white
above
the
water
and
not
far
from
him
young
eagles
were
whistling
and
flapping
their
wings
at
last
the
crowing
of
a
cock
reached
him
from
the
distant
village
followed
by
the
note
of
another
which
was
again
answered
by
yet
other
voices
to
wake
them
thought
lukashka
who
had
finished
his
ramrod
and
felt
his
eyes
growing
heavy
turning
to
his
comrades
he
managed
to
make
out
which
pair
of
legs
belonged
to
whom
when
it
suddenly
seemed
to
him
that
he
heard
something
splash
on
the
other
side
of
the
terek
he
turned
again
towards
the
horizon
beyond
the
hills
where
day
was
breaking
under
the
upturned
crescent
glanced
at
the
outline
of
the
opposite
bank
at
the
terek
and
at
the
now
distinctly
visible
driftwood
upon
it
for
one
instant
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
moving
and
that
the
terek
with
the
drifting
wood
remained
stationary
again
he
peered
out
one
large
black
log
with
a
branch
particularly
attracted
his
attention
the
tree
was
floating
in
a
strange
way
right
down
the
middle
of
the
stream
neither
rocking
nor
whirling
it
even
appeared
not
to
be
floating
altogether
with
the
current
but
to
be
crossing
it
in
the
direction
of
the
shallows
lukashka
stretching
out
his
neck
watched
it
intently
the
tree
floated
to
the
shallows
stopped
and
shifted
in
a
peculiar
manner
lukashka
thought
he
saw
an
arm
stretched
out
from
beneath
the
tree
i
killed
an
abrek
all
by
myself
he
thought
and
seized
his
gun
with
a
swift
unhurried
movement
putting
up
his
placing
the
gun
upon
it
and
holding
it
noiselessly
in
position
cocking
the
trigger
with
bated
breath
he
took
aim
still
peering
out
intently
wo
wake
them
he
thought
but
his
heart
began
beating
so
fast
that
he
remained
motionless
listening
suddenly
the
trunk
gave
a
plunge
and
again
began
to
float
across
the
stream
towards
our
bank
not
to
miss
thought
he
and
now
by
the
faint
light
of
the
moon
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
tartar
head
in
front
of
the
floating
wood
he
aimed
straight
at
the
head
which
appeared
to
be
quite
near
just
at
the
end
of
his
rifle
barrel
he
glanced
cross
enough
it
is
an
abrek
he
thought
joyfully
and
suddenly
rising
to
his
knees
he
again
took
aim
having
found
the
sight
barely
visible
at
the
end
of
the
long
gun
he
said
the
name
of
the
father
and
of
the
son
in
the
cossack
way
learnt
in
his
childhood
and
pulled
the
trigger
a
flash
of
lightning
lit
up
for
an
instant
the
reeds
and
the
water
and
the
sharp
abrupt
report
of
the
shot
was
carried
across
the
river
changing
into
a
prolonged
roll
somewhere
in
the
far
distance
the
piece
of
driftwood
now
floated
not
across
but
with
the
current
rocking
and
whirling
i
say
exclaimed
ergushov
seizing
his
musket
and
raising
himself
behind
the
log
near
which
he
was
lying
up
you
devil
whispered
lukashka
grinding
his
teeth
have
you
shot
asked
nazarka
was
it
lukashka
lukashka
did
not
answer
he
was
reloading
his
gun
and
watching
the
floating
wood
a
little
way
off
it
stopped
on
a
and
from
behind
it
something
large
that
rocked
in
the
water
came
into
view
did
you
shoot
why
do
you
speak
insisted
the
cossacks
i
tell
you
said
lukashka
humbug
did
the
gun
go
off
killed
an
abrek
that
what
i
fired
at
muttered
lukashka
in
a
voice
choked
by
emotion
as
he
jumped
to
his
feet
man
was
swimming
he
said
pointing
to
the
sandbank
killed
him
just
look
there
done
with
your
humbugging
said
ergushov
again
rubbing
his
eyes
done
with
what
look
there
said
lukashka
seizing
him
by
the
shoulders
and
pulling
him
with
such
force
that
ergushov
groaned
he
looked
in
the
direction
in
which
lukashka
pointed
and
discerning
a
body
immediately
changed
his
tone
lord
but
i
say
more
will
come
i
tell
you
the
truth
said
he
softly
and
began
examining
his
musket
was
a
scout
swimming
across
either
the
others
are
here
already
or
are
not
far
off
on
the
other
side
i
tell
you
for
sure
lukashka
was
unfastening
his
belt
and
taking
off
his
circassian
coat
are
you
up
to
you
idiot
exclaimed
ergushov
show
yourself
and
you
lost
all
for
nothing
i
tell
you
true
if
killed
him
he
wo
escape
let
me
have
a
little
powder
for
my
you
have
some
nazarka
you
go
back
to
the
cordon
and
look
alive
but
do
go
along
the
bank
or
you
be
killed
i
tell
you
true
me
going
alone
go
yourself
said
nazarka
angrily
having
taken
off
his
coat
lukashka
went
down
to
the
bank
go
in
i
tell
you
said
ergushov
putting
some
powder
on
the
pan
he
not
moving
i
can
see
it
nearly
morning
wait
till
they
come
from
the
cordon
you
go
nazarka
you
afraid
do
be
afraid
i
tell
you
i
say
lukashka
tell
us
how
you
did
it
said
nazarka
lukashka
changed
his
mind
about
going
into
the
water
just
then
quick
to
the
cordon
and
i
will
watch
tell
the
cossacks
to
send
out
the
patrol
if
the
abreks
are
on
this
side
they
must
be
caught
said
he
what
i
say
they
get
off
said
ergushov
rising
they
must
be
caught
ergushov
and
nazarka
rose
and
crossing
themselves
started
off
for
the
cordon
not
along
the
riverbank
but
breaking
their
way
through
the
brambles
to
reach
a
path
in
the
wood
mind
lukashka
they
may
cut
you
down
here
so
you
best
keep
a
sharp
i
tell
you
along
i
know
muttered
lukashka
and
having
examined
his
gun
again
he
sat
down
behind
the
log
he
remained
alone
and
sat
gazing
at
the
shallows
and
listening
for
the
cossacks
but
it
was
some
distance
to
the
cordon
and
he
was
tormented
by
impatience
he
kept
thinking
that
the
other
abreks
who
were
with
the
one
he
had
killed
would
escape
he
was
vexed
with
the
abreks
who
were
going
to
escape
just
as
he
had
been
with
the
boar
that
had
escaped
the
evening
before
he
glanced
round
and
at
the
opposite
bank
expecting
every
moment
to
see
a
man
and
having
arranged
his
he
was
ready
to
fire
the
idea
that
he
might
himself
be
killed
never
entered
his
head
chapter
ix
it
was
growing
light
the
chechen
body
which
was
gently
rocking
in
the
shallow
water
was
now
clearly
visible
suddenly
the
reeds
rustled
not
far
from
luke
and
he
heard
steps
and
saw
the
feathery
tops
of
the
reeds
moving
he
set
his
gun
at
full
cock
and
muttered
the
name
of
the
father
and
of
the
son
but
when
the
cock
clicked
the
sound
of
steps
ceased
cossacks
do
kill
your
daddy
said
a
deep
bass
voice
calmly
and
moving
the
reeds
apart
daddy
eroshka
came
up
close
to
luke
very
nearly
killed
you
by
god
i
did
said
lukashka
have
you
shot
asked
the
old
man
his
sonorous
voice
resounded
through
the
wood
and
downward
along
the
river
suddenly
dispelling
the
mysterious
quiet
of
night
around
the
cossack
it
was
as
if
everything
had
suddenly
become
lighter
and
more
distinct
now
uncle
you
have
not
seen
anything
but
i
killed
a
beast
said
lukashka
uncocking
his
gun
and
getting
up
with
unnatural
calmness
the
old
man
was
staring
intently
at
the
white
back
now
clearly
visible
against
which
the
terek
rippled
was
swimming
with
a
log
on
his
back
i
spied
him
out
look
there
there
he
got
blue
trousers
and
a
gun
i
think
do
you
see
inquired
luke
can
one
help
seeing
said
the
old
man
angrily
and
a
serious
and
stern
expression
appeared
on
his
face
killed
a
brave
he
said
apparently
with
regret
i
sat
here
and
suddenly
saw
something
dark
on
the
other
side
i
spied
him
when
he
was
still
over
there
it
was
as
if
a
man
had
come
there
and
fallen
in
strange
and
a
piece
of
driftwood
a
piece
comes
floating
not
with
the
stream
but
across
it
and
what
do
i
see
but
a
head
appearing
from
under
it
strange
i
stretched
out
of
the
reeds
but
could
see
nothing
then
i
rose
and
he
must
have
heard
the
beast
and
crept
out
into
the
shallow
and
looked
about
no
you
do
i
said
as
soon
as
he
landed
and
looked
round
you
wo
get
away
oh
there
was
something
choking
me
i
got
my
gun
ready
but
did
not
stir
and
looked
out
he
waited
a
little
and
then
swam
out
again
and
when
he
came
into
the
moonlight
i
could
see
his
whole
back
in
the
name
of
the
father
and
of
the
son
and
of
the
holy
ghost
and
through
the
smoke
i
see
him
struggling
he
moaned
or
so
it
seemed
to
me
ah
i
thought
the
lord
be
thanked
i
killed
him
and
when
he
drifted
onto
the
i
could
see
him
distinctly
he
tried
to
get
up
but
could
he
struggled
a
bit
and
then
lay
down
everything
could
be
seen
look
he
does
not
move
he
must
be
dead
the
cossacks
have
gone
back
to
the
cordon
in
case
there
should
be
any
more
of
them
so
you
got
him
said
the
old
man
is
far
away
now
my
lad
and
again
he
shook
his
head
sadly
just
then
the
sound
reached
them
of
breaking
bushes
and
the
loud
voices
of
cossacks
approaching
along
the
bank
on
horseback
and
on
foot
you
bringing
the
skiff
shouted
lukashka
a
trump
luke
lug
it
to
the
bank
shouted
one
of
the
cossacks
without
waiting
for
the
skiff
lukashka
began
to
undress
keeping
an
eye
all
the
while
on
his
prey
a
bit
nazarka
is
bringing
the
skiff
shouted
the
corporal
fool
maybe
he
is
alive
and
only
pretending
take
your
dagger
with
you
shouted
another
cossack
along
cried
luke
pulling
off
his
trousers
he
quickly
undressed
and
crossing
himself
jumped
plunging
with
a
splash
into
the
river
then
with
long
strokes
of
his
white
arms
lifting
his
back
high
out
of
the
water
and
breathing
deeply
he
swam
across
the
current
of
the
terek
towards
the
shallows
a
crowd
of
cossacks
stood
on
the
bank
talking
loudly
three
horsemen
rode
off
to
patrol
the
skiff
appeared
round
a
bend
lukashka
stood
up
on
the
sandbank
leaned
over
the
body
and
gave
it
a
couple
of
shakes
dead
he
shouted
in
a
shrill
voice
the
chechen
had
been
shot
in
the
head
he
had
on
a
pair
of
blue
trousers
a
shirt
and
a
circassian
coat
and
a
gun
and
dagger
were
tied
to
his
back
above
all
these
a
large
branch
was
tied
and
it
was
this
which
at
first
had
misled
lukashka
a
carp
you
landed
cried
one
of
the
cossacks
who
had
assembled
in
a
circle
as
the
body
lifted
out
of
the
skiff
was
laid
on
the
bank
pressing
down
the
grass
yellow
he
is
said
another

our
fellows
gone
to
search
i
expect
the
rest
of
them
are
on
the
other
bank
if
this
one
had
not
been
a
scout
he
would
not
have
swum
that
way
why
else
should
he
swim
alone
said
a
third
have
been
a
smart
one
to
offer
himself
before
the
others
a
regular
brave
said
lukashka
mockingly
shivering
as
he
wrung
out
his
clothes
that
had
got
wet
on
the
bank
beard
is
dyed
and
cropped
he
has
tied
a
bag
with
a
coat
in
it
to
his
back
would
make
it
easier
for
him
to
swim
said
some
one
say
lukashka
said
the
corporal
who
was
holding
the
dagger
and
gun
taken
from
the
dead
man
the
dagger
for
yourself
and
the
coat
too
but
i
give
you
three
rubles
for
the
gun
you
see
it
has
a
hole
in
it
said
he
blowing
into
the
muzzle
want
it
just
for
a
souvenir
lukashka
did
not
answer
evidently
this
sort
of
begging
vexed
him
but
he
knew
it
could
not
be
avoided
what
a
devil
said
he
frowning
and
throwing
down
the
coat
at
least
it
were
a
good
coat
but
it
a
mere
rag
do
to
fetch
firewood
in
said
one
of
the
cossacks
i
go
home
said
lukashka
evidently
forgetting
his
vexation
and
wishing
to
get
some
advantage
out
of
having
to
give
a
present
to
his
superior
right
you
may
go
the
body
beyond
the
cordon
lads
said
the
corporal
still
examining
the
gun
put
a
shelter
over
him
from
the
sun
perhaps
they
send
from
the
mountains
to
ransom
it
is
hot
yet
said
someone
supposing
a
jackal
tears
him
would
that
be
well
remarked
another
cossack
set
a
watch
if
they
should
come
to
ransom
him
it
wo
do
for
him
to
have
been
torn
lukashka
whatever
you
do
you
must
stand
a
pail
of
vodka
for
the
lads
said
the
corporal
gaily
course
that
the
custom
chimed
in
the
cossacks
what
luck
god
has
sent
you
without
ever
having
seen
anything
of
the
kind
before
you
killed
a
brave
the
dagger
and
coat
and
do
be
stingy
and
i
let
you
have
the
trousers
too
said
lukashka
too
tight
for
me
he
was
a
thin
devil
one
cossack
bought
the
coat
for
a
ruble
and
another
gave
the
price
of
two
pails
of
vodka
for
the
dagger
lads
i
stand
you
a
pail
said
luke
bring
it
myself
from
the
village
cut
up
the
trousers
into
kerchiefs
for
the
girls
said
nazarka
the
cossacks
burst
out
laughing
done
laughing
said
the
corporal
take
the
body
away
why
have
you
put
the
nasty
thing
by
the
hut
are
you
standing
there
for
haul
him
along
lads
shouted
lukashka
in
a
commanding
voice
to
the
cossacks
who
reluctantly
took
hold
of
the
body
obeying
him
as
though
he
were
their
chief
after
dragging
the
body
along
for
a
few
steps
the
cossacks
let
fall
the
legs
which
dropped
with
a
lifeless
jerk
and
stepping
apart
they
then
stood
silent
for
a
few
moments
nazarka
came
up
and
straightened
the
head
which
was
turned
to
one
side
so
that
the
round
wound
above
the
temple
and
the
whole
of
the
dead
man
face
were
visible
what
a
mark
he
has
made
right
in
the
brain
he
said
wo
get
lost
his
owners
will
always
know
him
no
one
answered
and
again
the
angel
of
silence
flew
over
the
cossacks
the
sun
had
risen
high
and
its
diverging
beams
were
lighting
up
the
dewy
grass
near
by
the
terek
murmured
in
the
awakened
wood
and
greeting
the
morning
the
pheasants
called
to
one
another
the
cossacks
stood
still
and
silent
around
the
dead
man
gazing
at
him
the
brown
body
with
nothing
on
but
the
wet
blue
trousers
held
by
a
girdle
over
the
sunken
stomach
was
well
shaped
and
handsome
the
muscular
arms
lay
stretched
straight
out
by
his
sides
the
blue
freshly
shaven
round
head
with
the
clotted
wound
on
one
side
of
it
was
thrown
back
the
smooth
tanned
forehead
contrasted
sharply
with
the
shaven
part
of
the
head
the
open
glassy
eyes
with
lowered
pupils
stared
upwards
seeming
to
gaze
past
everything
under
the
red
trimmed
moustache
the
fine
lips
drawn
at
the
corners
seemed
stiffened
into
a
smile
of
subtle
raillery
the
fingers
of
the
small
hands
covered
with
red
hairs
were
bent
inward
and
the
nails
were
dyed
red
lukashka
had
not
yet
dressed
he
was
wet
his
neck
was
redder
and
his
eyes
brighter
than
usual
his
broad
jaws
twitched
and
from
his
healthy
body
a
hardly
perceptible
steam
rose
in
the
fresh
morning
air
too
was
a
man
he
muttered
evidently
admiring
the
corpse
if
you
had
fallen
into
his
hands
you
would
have
had
short
shrift
said
one
of
the
cossacks
the
angel
of
silence
had
taken
wing
the
cossacks
began
bustling
about
and
talking
two
of
them
went
to
cut
brushwood
for
a
shelter
others
strolled
towards
the
cordon
luke
and
nazarka
ran
to
get
ready
to
go
to
the
village
half
an
hour
later
they
were
both
on
their
way
homewards
talking
incessantly
and
almost
running
through
the
dense
woods
which
separated
the
terek
from
the
village
do
tell
her
i
sent
you
but
just
go
and
find
out
if
her
husband
is
at
home
luke
was
saying
in
his
shrill
voice
i
go
round
to
yamka
too
said
the
devoted
nazarka
have
a
spree
shall
we
should
we
have
one
if
not
replied
luke
when
they
reached
the
village
the
two
cossacks
drank
and
lay
down
to
sleep
till
evening
chapter
x
on
the
third
day
after
the
events
above
described
two
companies
of
a
caucasian
infantry
regiment
arrived
at
the
cossack
village
of
novomlinsk
the
horses
had
been
unharnessed
and
the
companies
wagons
were
standing
in
the
square
the
cooks
had
dug
a
pit
and
with
logs
gathered
from
various
yards
where
they
had
not
been
sufficiently
securely
stored
were
now
cooking
the
food
the
were
settling
accounts
with
the
soldiers
the
service
corps
men
were
driving
piles
in
the
ground
to
which
to
tie
the
horses
and
the
quartermasters
were
going
about
the
streets
just
as
if
they
were
at
home
showing
officers
and
men
to
their
quarters
here
were
green
ammunition
boxes
in
a
line
the
company
carts
horses
and
cauldrons
in
which
buckwheat
porridge
was
being
cooked
here
were
the
captain
and
the
lieutenant
and
the
onisim
mikhaylovich
and
all
this
was
in
the
cossack
village
where
it
was
reported
that
the
companies
were
ordered
to
take
up
their
quarters
therefore
they
were
at
home
here
but
why
they
were
stationed
there
who
the
cossacks
were
and
whether
they
wanted
the
troops
to
be
there
and
whether
they
were
old
believers
or
not
was
all
quite
immaterial
having
received
their
pay
and
been
dismissed
tired
out
and
covered
with
dust
the
soldiers
noisily
and
in
disorder
like
a
swarm
of
bees
about
to
settle
spread
over
the
squares
and
streets
quite
regardless
of
the
cossacks
ill
will
chattering
merrily
and
with
their
muskets
clinking
by
twos
and
threes
they
entered
the
huts
and
hung
up
their
accoutrements
unpacked
their
bags
and
bantered
the
women
at
their
favourite
spot
round
the
a
large
group
of
soldiers
assembled
and
with
little
pipes
between
their
teeth
they
gazed
now
at
the
smoke
which
rose
into
the
hot
sky
becoming
visible
when
it
thickened
into
white
clouds
as
it
rose
and
now
at
the
camp
fires
which
were
quivering
in
the
pure
air
like
molten
glass
and
bantered
and
made
fun
of
the
cossack
men
and
women
because
they
do
not
live
at
all
like
russians
in
all
the
yards
one
could
see
soldiers
and
hear
their
laughter
and
the
exasperated
and
shrill
cries
of
cossack
women
defending
their
houses
and
refusing
to
give
the
soldiers
water
or
cooking
utensils
little
boys
and
girls
clinging
to
their
mothers
and
to
each
other
followed
all
the
movements
of
the
troopers
never
before
seen
by
them
with
frightened
curiosity
or
ran
after
them
at
a
respectful
distance
the
old
cossacks
came
out
silently
and
dismally
and
sat
on
the
earthen
embankments
of
their
huts
and
watched
the
soldiers
activity
with
an
air
of
leaving
it
all
to
the
will
of
god
without
understanding
what
would
come
of
it
olenin
who
had
joined
the
caucasian
army
as
a
cadet
three
months
before
was
quartered
in
one
of
the
best
houses
in
the
village
the
house
of
the
cornet
elias
vasilich
that
is
to
say
at
granny
ulitka
knows
what
it
will
be
like
dmitri
andreich
said
the
panting
vanyusha
to
olenin
who
dressed
in
a
circassian
coat
and
mounted
on
a
kabarda
horse
which
he
had
bought
in
groznoe
was
after
a
march
gaily
entering
the
yard
of
the
quarters
assigned
to
him
what
the
matter
he
asked
caressing
his
horse
and
looking
merrily
at
the
perspiring
dishevelled
and
worried
vanyusha
who
had
arrived
with
the
baggage
wagons
and
was
unpacking
olenin
looked
quite
a
different
man
in
place
of
his
lips
and
chin
he
had
a
youthful
moustache
and
a
small
beard
instead
of
a
sallow
complexion
the
result
of
nights
turned
into
day
his
cheeks
his
forehead
and
the
skin
behind
his
ears
were
now
red
with
healthy
sunburn
in
place
of
a
clean
new
black
suit
he
wore
a
dirty
white
circassian
coat
with
a
deeply
pleated
skirt
and
he
bore
arms
instead
of
a
freshly
starched
collar
his
neck
was
tightly
clasped
by
the
red
band
of
his
silk
beshmet
he
wore
circassian
dress
but
did
not
wear
it
well
and
anyone
would
have
known
him
for
a
russian
and
not
a
tartar
brave
it
was
the
thing
but
not
the
real
thing
but
for
all
that
his
whole
person
breathed
health
joy
and
satisfaction
it
seems
funny
to
you
said
vanyusha
just
try
to
talk
to
these
people
yourself
they
set
themselves
against
one
and
there
an
end
of
it
you
ca
get
as
much
as
a
word
out
of
them
vanyusha
angrily
threw
down
a
pail
on
the
threshold
they
do
seem
like
russians
should
speak
to
the
chief
of
the
village
i
do
know
where
he
lives
said
vanyusha
in
an
offended
tone
has
upset
you
so
asked
olenin
looking
round
devil
only
knows
faugh
there
is
no
real
master
here
they
say
he
has
gone
to
some
kind
of
kriga
and
the
old
woman
is
a
real
devil
god
preserve
us
answered
vanyusha
putting
his
hands
to
his
head
we
shall
live
here
i
do
know
they
are
worse
than
tartars
i
do
declare
though
they
consider
themselves
christians
a
tartar
is
bad
enough
but
all
the
same
he
is
more
noble
gone
to
the
kriga
indeed
what
this
kriga
they
have
invented
is
i
do
know
concluded
vanyusha
and
turned
aside
not
as
it
is
in
the
serfs
quarters
at
home
eh
chaffed
olenin
without
dismounting
sir
may
i
have
your
horse
said
vanyusha
evidently
perplexed
by
this
new
order
of
things
but
resigning
himself
to
his
fate
a
tartar
is
more
noble
eh
vanyusha
repeated
olenin
dismounting
and
slapping
the
saddle
you
laughing
you
think
it
funny
muttered
vanyusha
angrily
do
be
angry
vanyusha
replied
olenin
still
smiling
a
minute
i
go
and
speak
to
the
people
of
the
house
you
see
i
shall
arrange
everything
you
do
know
what
a
jolly
life
we
shall
have
here
only
do
get
upset
vanyusha
did
not
answer
screwing
up
his
eyes
he
looked
contemptuously
after
his
master
and
shook
his
head
vanyusha
regarded
olenin
as
only
his
master
and
olenin
regarded
vanyusha
as
only
his
servant
and
they
would
both
have
been
much
surprised
if
anyone
had
told
them
that
they
were
friends
as
they
really
were
without
knowing
it
themselves
vanyusha
had
been
taken
into
his
proprietor
house
when
he
was
only
eleven
and
when
olenin
was
the
same
age
when
olenin
was
fifteen
he
gave
vanyusha
lessons
for
a
time
and
taught
him
to
read
french
of
which
the
latter
was
inordinately
proud
and
when
in
specially
good
spirits
he
still
let
off
french
words
always
laughing
stupidly
when
he
did
so
olenin
ran
up
the
steps
of
the
porch
and
pushed
open
the
door
of
the
hut
maryanka
wearing
nothing
but
a
pink
smock
as
all
cossack
women
do
in
the
house
jumped
away
from
the
door
frightened
and
pressing
herself
against
the
wall
covered
the
lower
part
of
her
face
with
the
broad
sleeve
of
her
tartar
smock
having
opened
the
door
wider
olenin
in
the
of
the
passage
saw
the
whole
tall
shapely
figure
of
the
young
cossack
girl
with
the
quick
and
eager
curiosity
of
youth
he
involuntarily
noticed
the
firm
maidenly
form
revealed
by
the
fine
print
smock
and
the
beautiful
black
eyes
fixed
on
him
with
childlike
terror
and
wild
curiosity
is
she
thought
olenin
there
will
be
many
others
like
her
came
at
once
into
his
head
and
he
opened
the
inner
door
old
granny
ulitka
also
dressed
only
in
a
smock
was
stooping
with
her
back
turned
to
him
sweeping
the
floor
to
you
mother
i
come
about
my
lodgings
he
began
the
cossack
woman
without
unbending
turned
her
severe
but
still
handsome
face
towards
him
have
you
come
here
for
want
to
mock
at
us
eh
i
teach
you
to
mock
may
the
black
plague
seize
you
she
shouted
looking
askance
from
under
her
frowning
brow
at
the
olenin
had
at
first
imagined
that
the
gallant
caucasian
army
of
which
he
was
a
member
would
be
everywhere
received
joyfully
and
especially
by
the
cossacks
our
comrades
in
the
war
and
he
therefore
felt
perplexed
by
this
reception
without
losing
presence
of
mind
however
he
tried
to
explain
that
he
meant
to
pay
for
his
lodgings
but
the
old
woman
would
not
give
him
a
hearing
have
you
come
for
who
wants
a
pest
like
you
with
your
scraped
face
you
just
wait
a
bit
when
the
master
returns
he
show
you
your
place
i
do
want
your
dirty
money
a
likely
thing
just
as
if
we
had
never
seen
any
you
stink
the
house
out
with
your
beastly
tobacco
and
want
to
put
it
right
with
money
think
we
never
seen
a
pest
may
you
be
shot
in
your
bowels
and
your
heart
shrieked
the
old
woman
in
a
piercing
voice
interrupting
olenin
seems
vanyusha
was
right
thought
olenin
a
tartar
would
be
nobler
and
followed
by
granny
ulitka
abuse
he
went
out
of
the
hut
as
he
was
leaving
maryanka
still
wearing
only
her
pink
smock
but
with
her
forehead
covered
down
to
her
eyes
by
a
white
kerchief
suddenly
slipped
out
from
the
passage
past
him
pattering
rapidly
down
the
steps
with
her
bare
feet
she
ran
from
the
porch
stopped
and
looking
round
hastily
with
laughing
eyes
at
the
young
man
vanished
round
the
corner
of
the
hut
her
firm
youthful
step
the
untamed
look
of
the
eyes
glistening
from
under
the
white
kerchief
and
the
firm
stately
build
of
the
young
beauty
struck
olenin
even
more
powerfully
than
before
it
must
be
she
he
thought
and
troubling
his
head
still
less
about
the
lodgings
he
kept
looking
round
at
maryanka
as
he
approached
vanyusha
you
see
the
girl
too
is
quite
savage
just
like
a
wild
filly
said
vanyusha
who
though
still
busy
with
the
luggage
wagon
had
now
cheered
up
a
bit
fame
he
added
in
a
loud
triumphant
voice
and
burst
out
laughing
chapter
xi
towards
evening
the
master
of
the
house
returned
from
his
fishing
and
having
learnt
that
the
cadet
would
pay
for
the
lodging
pacified
the
old
woman
and
satisfied
vanyusha
demands
everything
was
arranged
in
the
new
quarters
their
hosts
moved
into
the
winter
hut
and
let
their
summer
hut
to
the
cadet
for
three
rubles
a
month
olenin
had
something
to
eat
and
went
to
sleep
towards
evening
he
woke
up
washed
and
made
himself
tidy
dined
and
having
lit
a
cigarette
sat
down
by
the
window
that
looked
onto
the
street
it
was
cooler
the
slanting
shadow
of
the
hut
with
its
ornamental
gables
fell
across
the
dusty
road
and
even
bent
upwards
at
the
base
of
the
wall
of
the
house
opposite
the
steep
roof
of
that
house
shone
in
the
rays
of
the
setting
sun
the
air
grew
fresher
everything
was
peaceful
in
the
village
the
soldiers
had
settled
down
and
become
quiet
the
herds
had
not
yet
been
driven
home
and
the
people
had
not
returned
from
their
work
olenin
lodging
was
situated
almost
at
the
end
of
the
village
at
rare
intervals
from
somewhere
far
beyond
the
terek
in
those
parts
whence
olenin
had
just
come
the
chechen
or
the
kumytsk
plain
came
muffled
sounds
of
firing
olenin
was
feeling
very
well
contented
after
three
months
of
bivouac
life
his
newly
washed
face
was
fresh
and
his
powerful
body
clean
an
unaccustomed
sensation
after
the
campaign
and
in
all
his
rested
limbs
he
was
conscious
of
a
feeling
of
tranquillity
and
strength
his
mind
too
felt
fresh
and
clear
he
thought
of
the
campaign
and
of
past
dangers
he
remembered
that
he
had
faced
them
no
worse
than
other
men
and
that
he
was
accepted
as
a
comrade
among
valiant
caucasians
his
moscow
recollections
were
left
behind
heaven
knows
how
far
the
old
life
was
wiped
out
and
a
quite
new
life
had
begun
in
which
there
were
as
yet
no
mistakes
here
as
a
new
man
among
new
men
he
could
gain
a
new
and
good
reputation
he
was
conscious
of
a
youthful
and
unreasoning
joy
of
life
looking
now
out
of
the
window
at
the
boys
spinning
their
tops
in
the
shadow
of
the
house
now
round
his
neat
new
lodging
he
thought
how
pleasantly
he
would
settle
down
to
this
new
cossack
village
life
now
and
then
he
glanced
at
the
mountains
and
the
blue
sky
and
an
appreciation
of
the
solemn
grandeur
of
nature
mingled
with
his
reminiscences
and
dreams
his
new
life
had
begun
not
as
he
imagined
it
would
when
he
left
moscow
but
unexpectedly
well
mountains
the
mountains
the
mountains
they
permeated
all
his
thoughts
and
feelings
kissed
his
dog
and
licked
the
jug
daddy
eroshka
has
kissed
his
dog
suddenly
the
little
cossacks
who
had
been
spinning
their
tops
under
the
window
shouted
looking
towards
the
side
street
drunk
his
bitch
and
his
dagger
shouted
the
boys
crowding
together
and
stepping
backwards
these
shouts
were
addressed
to
daddy
eroshka
who
with
his
gun
on
his
shoulder
and
some
pheasants
hanging
at
his
girdle
was
returning
from
his
shooting
expedition
have
done
wrong
lads
i
have
he
said
vigorously
swinging
his
arms
and
looking
up
at
the
windows
on
both
sides
of
the
street
have
drunk
the
bitch
it
was
wrong
he
repeated
evidently
vexed
but
pretending
not
to
care
olenin
was
surprised
by
the
boys
behavior
towards
the
old
hunter
but
was
still
more
struck
by
the
expressive
intelligent
face
and
the
powerful
build
of
the
man
whom
they
called
daddy
eroshka
daddy
here
cossack
he
called
here
the
old
man
looked
into
the
window
and
stopped
evening
good
man
he
said
lifting
his
little
cap
off
his
cropped
head
evening
good
man
replied
olenin

it
the
youngsters

shouting
at

daddy
eroshka
came
up
to
the
window
they
teasing
the
old
man
no
matter
i
like
it
let
them
joke
about
their
old
daddy
he
said
with
those
firm
musical
intonations
with
which
old
and
venerable
people
speak
you
an
army
commander
he
added
i
am
a
cadet
but
where
did
you
kill
those
pheasants
asked
olenin
dispatched
these
three
hens
in
the
forest
answered
the
old
man
turning
his
broad
back
towards
the
window
to
show
the
hen
pheasants
which
were
hanging
with
their
heads
tucked
into
his
belt
and
staining
his
coat
with
blood
you
seen
any
he
asked
a
brace
if
you
like
here
you
are
and
he
handed
two
of
the
pheasants
in
at
the
window
you
a
sportsman
yourself
he
asked
am
during
the
campaign
i
killed
four
myself
what
a
lot
said
the
old
man
sarcastically
are

drinker

like
a
drink

said
daddy
eroshka
in
said
olenin
have
a
drop
of
chikhir
might
as
well
said
the
old
man
take
the
pheasants
the
old
man
face
showed
that
he
liked
the
cadet
he
had
seen
at
once
that
he
could
get
free
drinks
from
him
and
that
therefore
it
would
be
all
right
to
give
him
a
brace
of
pheasants
soon
daddy
eroshka
figure
appeared
in
the
doorway
of
the
hut
and
it
was
only
then
that
olenin
became
fully
conscious
of
the
enormous
size
and
sturdy
build
of
this
man
whose
face
with
its
perfectly
white
broad
beard
was
all
furrowed
by
deep
lines
produced
by
age
and
toil
for
an
old
man
the
muscles
of
his
legs
arms
and
shoulders
were
quite
exceptionally
large
and
prominent
there
were
deep
scars
on
his
head
under
the
hair
his
thick
sinewy
neck
was
covered
with
deep
intersecting
folds
like
a
bull
his
horny
hands
were
bruised
and
scratched
he
stepped
lightly
and
easily
over
the
threshold
unslung
his
gun
and
placed
it
in
a
corner
and
casting
a
rapid
glance
round
the
room
noted
the
value
of
the
goods
and
chattels
deposited
in
the
hut
and
with
toes
stepped
softly
in
his
sandals
of
raw
hide
into
the
middle
of
the
room
he
brought
with
him
a
penetrating
but
not
unpleasant
smell
of
chikhir
wine
vodka
gunpowder
and
congealed
blood
daddy
eroshka
bowed
down
before
the
icons
smoothed
his
beard
and
approaching
olenin
held
out
his
thick
brown
hand
said
he
that
is
tartar
for
peace
be
unto
you
it
means

their
tongue

daddy
eroshka

his
head
reproachfully

daddy

continued
in
a
confidential
tone
after

had
gone
out

look
upon
you
as

vanyusha
who
meanwhile
had
finished
his
housekeeping
arrangements
and
had
even
been
shaved
by
the
company
barber
and
had
pulled
his
trousers
out
of
his
high
boots
as
a
sign
that
the
company
was
stationed
in
comfortable
quarters
was
in
excellent
spirits
he
looked
attentively
but
not
benevolently
at
eroshka
as
at
a
wild
beast
he
had
never
seen
before
shook
his
head
at
the
floor
which
the
old
man
had
dirtied
and
having
taken
two
bottles
from
under
a
bench
went
to
the
landlady
evening
kind
people

said

old
woman
gave
no
answer
the
girl
who
was
arranging
the
kerchief
on
her
head
before
a
little
tartar
mirror
looked
round
at
vanyusha
in
silence

vanyusha
jingling
the
coppers

his
pocket

added
much

old
woman
abruptly
quart

from

that
begun
my
precious
the
girl
took
the
keys
and
a
decanter
and
went
out
of
the
hut
with
vanyusha
me
who
is
that
young
woman
asked
olenin
pointing
to
maryanka
who
was
passing
the
window
the
old
man
winked
and
nudged
the
young
man
with
his
elbow
a
bit
said
he
and
reached
out
of
the
window
he
coughed
and
bellowed
dear
hallo
maryanka
my
girlie
wo
you
love
me
darling
i
a
wag
he
added
in
a
whisper
to
olenin
the
girl
not
turning
her
head
and
swinging
her
arms
regularly
and
vigorously
passed
the
window
with
the
peculiarly
smart
and
bold
gait
of
a
cossack
woman
and
only
turned
her
dark
shaded
eyes
slowly
towards
the
old
man
me
and
you
be
happy
shouted
eroshka
winking
and
he
looked
questioningly
at
the
cadet
a
fine
fellow
i
a
wag
he
added
a
regular
queen
that
girl
eh
is
lovely
said
olenin
her
here
no
said
the
old
man
that
one
a
match
is
being
arranged
with
lukashka
luke
a
fine
cossack
a
brave
who
killed

abrek

other

i

silver

said
it
i
do
it
get
you
a
regular
beauty
an
old
man
and
say
such
things
replied
olenin
it
a
sin
sin
where
the
sin
said
the
old
man
emphatically
sin
to
look
at
a
nice
girl
a
sin
to
have
some
fun
with
her
or
is
it
a
sin
to
love
her
is
that
so
in
your
parts
no
my
dear
fellow
it
not
a
sin
it
salvation
god
made
you
and
god
made
the
girl
too
he
made
it
all
so
it
is
no
sin
to
look
at
a
nice
girl
that
what
she
was
made
for
to
be
loved
and
to
give
joy
that
how
i
judge
it
my
good
fellow
having
crossed
the
yard
and
entered
a
cool
dark
storeroom
filled
with
barrels
maryanka
went
up
to
one
of
them
and
repeating
the
usual
prayer
plunged
a
dipper
into
it
vanyusha
standing
in
the
doorway
smiled
as
he
looked
at
her
he
thought
it
very
funny
that
she
had
only
a
smock
on
behind
and
tucked
up
in
front
and
still
funnier
that
she
wore
a
necklace
of
silver
coins
he
thought
this
quite
and
that
they
would
all
laugh
in
the
serfs
quarters
at
home
if
they
saw
a
girl
like
that
fille
comme
tres
bien
for
a
change
he
thought
tell
that
to
my
master
are
you
standing
in
the
light
for
you
devil
the
girl
suddenly
shouted
do
you
pass
me
the
decanter
having
filled
the
decanter
with
cool
red
wine
maryanka
handed
it
to
vanyusha
the
money
to
mother
she
said
pushing
away
the
hand
in
which
he
held
the
money
vanyusha
laughed
are
you
so
cross
little
dear
he
said
irresolutely
shuffling
with
his
feet
while
the
girl
was
covering
the
barrel
she
began
to
laugh
you
are
you
kind
my
master
and
i
are
very
kind
vanyusha
answered
decidedly
are
so
kind
that
wherever
we
have
stayed
our
hosts
were
always
very
grateful
it
because
he
generous
the
girl
stood
listening
is
your
master
married
she
asked
the
master
is
young
and
unmarried
because
noble
gentlemen
can
never
marry
young
said
vanyusha
didactically
likely
thing
see
what
a
buffalo
he
is
and
too
young
to
marry
is
he
the
chief
of
you
all
she
asked
master
is
a
cadet
that
means
he
not
yet
an
officer
but
more
important
than
a
general
he
an
important
man
because
not
only
our
colonel
but
the
tsar
himself
knows
him
proudly
explained
vanyusha
are
not
like
those
other
beggars
in
the
line
regiment
and
our
papa
himself
was
a
senator
he
had
more
than
a
thousand
serfs
all
his
own
and
they
send
us
a
thousand
rubles
at
a
time
that
why
everyone
likes
us
another
may
be
a
captain
but
have
no
money
the
use
of
that
away
i
lock
up
said
the
girl
interrupting
him
vanyusha
brought
olenin
the
wine
and
announced
that
fille
tres
joulie
and
laughing
stupidly
at
once
went
out

meanwhile
the

sounded
in

the

behind
the
distant
snowy
peaks

pale
bluish
shadow
spread
over
land
and
sky
above
the
darkened

just
discernible
were

and
the

hushed
in
the
village
the
cattle
having
been
attended
to
and
left
for
the
night
the
women
came
out
and
gathered
at
the
corners
of
the
streets
and
cracking
sunflower
seeds
with
their
teeth
settled
down
on

earthen
embankments
of
the
houses

on
maryanka

finished
milking

of

of
several

were
talking
about
the

of
the

cross
did
try
to

pointing
to
the
cossacks
who
were

down
the
street
towards
them
ergushov
has
managed
to
come
along
with
them
too
the
drunkard
lukashka
nazarka
and
ergushov
having
emptied
half
a
pail
of
vodka
were
coming
towards
the
girls
the
faces
of
all
three
but
especially
that
of
the
old
cossack
were
redder
than
usual
ergushov
was
reeling
and
kept
laughing
and
nudging
nazarka
in
the
ribs

he
shouted
to
the
girls

our
i

were
welcomed
with
the
words
a

health
lukashka
when
he
reached
the
group
slowly
raised
his
cap
and
stopped
in
front
of
the
girls
his
broad
cheekbones
and
neck
were
red
he
stood
and
spoke
softly
and
sedately
but
in
his
tranquillity
and
sedateness
there
was
more
of
animation
and
strength
than
in
all
loquacity
and
bustle
he
reminded
one
of
a
playful
colt
that
with
a
snort
and
a
flourish
of
its
tail
suddenly
stops
short
and
stands
as
though
nailed
to
the
ground
with
all
four
feet
lukashka
stood
quietly
in
front
of
the
girls
his
eyes
laughed
and
he
spoke
but
little
as
he
glanced
now
at
his
drunken
companions
and
now
at
the
girls
when
maryanka
joined
the
group
he
raised
his
cap
with
a
firm
deliberate
movement
moved
out
of
her
way
and
then
stepped
in
front
of
her
with
one
foot
a
little
forward
and
with
his
thumbs
in
his
belt
fingering
his
dagger
maryanka
answered
his
greeting
with
a
leisurely
bow
of
her
head
settled
down
on
the
and
took
some
seeds
out
of
the
bosom
of
her
smock
lukashka
keeping
his
eyes
fixed
on
maryanka
slowly
cracked
seeds
and
spat
out
the
shells
all
were
quiet
when
maryanka
joined
the
group
you
come
for
long
asked
a
woman
breaking
the
silence
morning
quietly
replied
lukashka
god
grant
you
get
something
good
said
the
cossack
glad
of
it
as
i
just
been
saying
i
say
so
too
put
in
the
tipsy
ergushov
laughing
a
lot
of
visitors
have
come
he
added
pointing
to
a
soldier
who
was
passing
by
soldiers
vodka
is
good
i
like
it
sent
three
of
the
devils

said
one
of
the
women
went
to
the
village
elders
but
they
say
nothing
can
be
done
ha
have
you
met
with
trouble
said
ergushov
expect
they
have
smoked
you
out
with
their
tobacco
asked
another
woman
as
much
as
you
like
in
the
yard
i
say
but
we
allow
it
inside
the
hut
not
if
the
elder
himself
comes
i
wo
allow
it
besides
they
may
rob
you
he
not

any
of
them
on
himself
no
fear
that
devil
son
of
an
elder
do
like

ergushov
began
again
i
also
heard
say
that
the
girls
will
have
to
make
the
beds
and
offer
them
chikhir
and
honey
said
nazarka
putting
one
foot
forward
and
tilting
his
cap
like
lukashka
ergushov
burst
into
a
roar
of
laughter
and
seizing
the
girl
nearest
to
him
he
embraced
her
tell
you
true
then
you
black
pitch
squealed
the
girl
tell
your
old
woman
her
shouted
he
quite
right
what
nazarka
says
a
circular
has
been
sent
round
he
can
read
you
know
quite
true
and
he
began
embracing
the
next
girl
are
you
up
to
you
beast
squealed
the
rosy
ustenka
laughing
and
lifting
her
arm
to
hit
him
the
cossack
stepped
aside
and
nearly
fell
they
say
girls
have
no
strength
and
you
nearly
killed
me
away
you
black
pitch
what
devil
has
brought
you
from
the
cordon
said
ustenka
and
turning
away
from
him
she
again
burst
out
laughing
were
asleep
and
missed
the
abrek
did
you
suppose
he
had
done
for
you
it
would
have
been
all
the
better
have
howled
i
expect
said
nazarka
laughing
a
likely
thing
look
she
does
care
she
howl
nazarka
eh
would
she
said
ergushov
lukishka
all
this
time
had
stood
silently
looking
at
maryanka
his
gaze
evidently
confused
the
girl
maryanka
i
hear
they
quartered
one
of
the
chiefs
on
you
he
said
drawing
nearer
maryanka
as
was
her
wont
waited
before
she
replied
and
slowly
raising
her
eyes
looked
at
the
cossack
lukashka
eyes
were
laughing
as
if
something
special
apart
from
what
was
said
was
taking
place
between
himself
and
the
girl
it
all
right
for
them
as
they
have
two
huts
replied
an
old
woman
on
maryanka
behalf
at
fomushkin
now
they
also
have
one
of
the
chiefs
quartered
on
them
and
they
say
one
whole
corner
is
packed
full
with
his
things
and
the
family
have
no
room
left
was
such
a
thing
ever
heard
of
as
that
they
should
turn
a
whole
horde
loose
in
the
village
she
said
what
the
plague
are
they
going
to
do
here
heard
say
they
build
a
bridge
across
the
terek
said
one
of
the
girls
i
been
told
that
they
will
dig
a
pit
to
put
the
girls
in
because
they
do
love
the
lads
said
nazarka
approaching
ustenka
and
he
again
made
a
whimsical
gesture
which
set
everybody
laughing
and
ergushov
passing
by
maryanka
who
was
next
in
turn
began
to
embrace
an
old
woman
do
you
hug
maryanka
you
should
do
it
to
each
in
turn
said
nazarka
my
old
one
is
sweeter
shouted
the
cossack
kissing
the
struggling
old
woman
throttle
me
she
screamed
laughing
the
tramp
of
regular
footsteps
at
the
other
end
of
the
street
interrupted
their
laughter
three
soldiers
in
their
cloaks
with
their
muskets
on
their
shoulders
were
marching
in
step
to
relieve
guard
by
the
ammunition
wagon
the
corporal
an
old
cavalry
man
looked
angrily
at
the
cossacks
and
led
his
men
straight
along
the
road
where
lukashka
and
nazarka
were
standing
so
that
they
should
have
to
get
out
of
the
way
nazarka
moved
but
lukashka
only
screwed
up
his
eyes
and
turned
his
broad
back
without
moving
from
his
place
are
standing
here
so
you
go
round
he
muttered
half
turning
his
head
and
tossing
it
contemptuously
in
the
direction
of
the
soldiers
the
soldiers
passed
by
in
silence
keeping
step
regularly
along
the
dusty
road
maryanka
began
laughing
and
all
the
other
girls
chimed
in
swells
said
nazarka
like
choristers
and
he
walked
a
few
steps
down
the
road
imitating
the
soldiers
again
everyone
broke
into
peals
of
laughter
lukashka
came
slowly
up
to
maryanka
where
have
you
put
up
the
chief
he
asked
maryanka
thought
for
a
moment
let
him
have
the
new
hut
she
said
is
he
old
or
young
asked
lukashka
sitting
down
beside
her
you
think
i
asked
answered
the
girl
went
to
get
him
some
chikhir
and
saw
him
sitting
at
the
window
with
daddy
eroshka
he
seemed
they
brought
a
whole
cartload
of
things
and
she
dropped
her
eyes
how
glad
i
am
that
i
got
leave
from
the
cordon
said
lukashka
moving
closer
to
the
girl
and
looking
straight
in
her
eyes
all
the
time
have
you
come
for
long
asked
maryanka
smiling
slightly
the
morning
give
me
some
sunflower
seeds
he
said
holding
out
his
hand
maryanka
now
smiled
outright
and
unfastened
the
neckband
of
her
smock
take
them
all
she
said
i
felt
so
dull
all
the
time
without
you
i
swear
i
did
he
said
in
a
calm
restrained
whisper
helping
himself
to
some
seeds
out
of
the
bosom
of
the
girl
smock
and
stooping
still
closer
over
her
he
continued
with
laughing
eyes
to
talk
to
her
in
low
tones
wo
come
i
tell
you
maryanka
suddenly
said
aloud
leaning
away
from
him
really
what
i
wanted
to
say
to
you
whispered
lukashka
the
heavens
do
come
maryanka
shook
her
head
but
did
so
with
a
smile
maryanka
hallo
nursey
mammy
is
calling
supper
time
shouted
maryanka
little
brother
running
towards
the
group
coming
replied
the
girl

dear

come
in
a
minute
lukashka
rose
and
raised
his
cap
expect
i
had
better
go
home
too
that
will
be
best
he
said
trying
to
appear
unconcerned
but
hardly
able
to
repress
a
smile
and
he
disappeared
behind
the
corner
of
the
house
meanwhile
night
had
entirely
enveloped
the
village
bright
stars
were
scattered
over
the
dark
sky
the
streets
became
dark
and
empty
nazarka
remained
with
the
women
on
the
and
their
laughter
was
still
heard
but
lukashka
having
slowly
moved
away
from
the
girls
crouched
down
like
a
cat
and
then
suddenly
started
running
lightly
holding
his
dagger
to
steady
it
not
homeward
however
but
towards
the
house
having
passed
two
streets
he
turned
into
a
lane
and
lifting
the
skirt
of
his
coat
sat
down
on
the
ground
in
the
shadow
of
a
fence
regular
cornet
daughter
he
thought
about
maryanka
even
have
a
lark
the
devil
but
just
wait
a
bit
the
approaching
footsteps
of
a
woman
attracted
his
attention
he
began
listening
and
laughed
all
by
himself
maryanka
with
bowed
head
striking
the
pales
of
the
fences
with
a
switch
was
walking
with
rapid
regular
strides
straight
towards
him
lukashka
rose
maryanka
started
and
stopped
an
accursed
devil
you
frightened
me
so
you
have
not
gone
home
she
said
and
laughed
aloud
lukashka
put
one
arm
round
her
and
with
the
other
hand
raised
her
face
i
wanted
to
tell
you
by
heaven
his
voice
trembled
and
broke
are
you
talking
of
at
night
time
answered
maryanka
is
waiting
for
me
and
you
better
go
to
your
sweetheart
and
freeing
herself
from
his
arms
she
ran
away
a
few
steps
when
she
had
reached
the
wattle
fence
of
her
home
she
stopped
and
turned
to
the
cossack
who
was
running
beside
her
and
still
trying
to
persuade
her
to
stay
a
while
with
him
what
do
you
want
to
say
and
she
again
began
laughing
laugh
at
me
maryanka
by
the
heaven
well
what
if
i
have
a
sweetheart
may
the
devil
take
her

say
the
word
and
now
i
love
you
i
do
anything
you
wish
here
they
are
and
he
jingled
the
money
in
his
pocket
we
can
live
splendidly
others
have
pleasures
and
i
i
get
no
pleasure
from
you
maryanka
dear
the
girl
did
not
answer
she
stood
before
him
breaking
her
switch
into
little
bits
with
a
rapid
movement
of
her
fingers
lukashka
suddenly
clenched
his
teeth
and
fists
why
keep
waiting
and
waiting
do
i
love
you
darling
you
can
do
what
you
like
with
me
said
he
suddenly
frowning
angrily
and
seizing
both
her
hands
the
calm
expression
of
maryanka
face
and
voice
did
not
change
bluster
lukashka
but
listen
to
me
she
answered
not
pulling
away
her
hands
but
holding
the
cossack
at
arm
length
true
i
am
a
girl
but
you
listen
to
me
it
does
not
depend
on
me
but
if
you
love
me

tell
you

my
hands

tell

nonsense
from

said
maryanka
without
turning
her
face
you
marry
me
marriage
does
not
depend
on
us
love
me
yourself
maryanka
dear
said
lukashka
from
sullen
and
furious
becoming
again
gentle
submissive
and
tender
and
smiling
as
he
looked
closely
into
her
eyes
maryanka
clung
to
him
and
kissed
him
firmly
on
the
lips
dear
she
whispered
pressing
him
convulsively
to
her
then
suddenly
tearing
herself
away
she
ran
into
the
gate
of
her
house
without
looking
round
in
spite
of
the
cossack
entreaties
to
wait
another
minute
to
hear
what
he
had
to
say
maryanka
did
not
stop
she
cried
be
seen
i
do
believe
that
devil
our
lodger

walking
about
the
yard
daughter
thought
lukashka

marry
me

is
all
very
well
but
you
just
love
me
he
found
nazarka
at
yamka
house
and
after
having
a
spree
with
him
went
to
dunayka
house
where
in
spite
of
her
not
being
faithful
to
him
he
spent
the
night
chapter
xiv
it
was
quite
true
that
olenin
had
been
walking
about
the
yard
when
maryanka
entered
the
gate
and
had
heard
her
say
devil
our
lodger
is
walking
about
he
had
spent
that
evening
with
daddy
eroshka
in
the
porch
of
his
new
lodging
he
had
had
a
table
a
samovar
wine
and
a
candle
brought
out
and
over
a
cup
of
tea
and
a
cigar
he
listened
to
the
tales
the
old
man
told
seated
on
the
threshold
at
his
feet
though
the
air
was
still
the
candle
dripped
and
flickered
now
lighting
up
the
post
of
the
porch
now
the
table
and
crockery
now
the
cropped
white
head
of
the
old
man
moths
circled
round
the
flame
and
shedding
the
dust
of
their
wings
fluttered
on
the
table
and
in
the
glasses
flew
into
the
candle
flame
and
disappeared
in
the
black
space
beyond
olenin
and
eroshka
had
emptied
five
bottles
of
chikhir
eroshka
filled
the
glasses
every
time
offering
one
to
olenin
drinking
his
health
and
talking
untiringly
he
told
of
cossack
life
in
the
old
days
of
his
father
broad
who
alone
had
carried
on
his
back
a
boar
carcass
weighing
three
hundredweight
and
drank
two
pails
of
chikhir
at
one
sitting
he
told
of
his
own
days
and
his
chum
girchik
with
whom
during
the
plague
he
used
to
smuggle
felt
cloaks
across
the
terek
he
told
how
one
morning
he
had
killed
two
deer
and
about
his
soul
who
used
to
run
to
him
at
the
cordon
at
night
he
told
all
this
so
eloquently
and
picturesquely
that
olenin
did
not
notice
how
time
passed
yes
my
dear
fellow
you
did
not
know
me
in
my
golden
days
then
i
have
shown
you
things
today
it
eroshka
licks
the
jug
but
then
eroshka
was
famous
in
the
whole
regiment
whose
was
the
finest
horse
who
had
a
gurda
sword
to
whom
should
one
go
to
get
a
drink
with
whom
go
on
the
spree
who
should
be
sent
to
the
mountains
to
kill
ahmet
khan
why
always
eroshka
whom
did
the
girls
love
always
eroshka
had
to
answer
for
it
because
i
was
a
real
brave
a
drinker
a
thief
i
used
to
seize
herds
of
horses
in
the
mountains
a
singer
i
was
a
master
of
every
art
there
are
no
cossacks
like
that
nowadays
it
disgusting
to
look
at
them
when
they
that
high
eroshka
held
his
hand
three
feet
from
the
ground
they
put
on
idiotic
boots
and
keep
looking
at
them
that
all
the
pleasure
they
know
or
they
drink
themselves
foolish
not
like
men
but
all
wrong
and
who
was
i
i
was
eroshka
the
thief
they
knew
me
not
only
in
this
village
but
up
in
the
mountains
tartar
princes
my
kunaks
used
to
come
to
see
me
i
used
to
be
everybody
kunak
if
he
was
a
tartar
with
a
tartar
an
armenian
with
an
armenian
a
soldier
with
a
soldier
an
officer
with
an
officer
i
did
care
as
long
as
he
was
a
drinker
he
says
you
should
cleanse
yourself
from
intercourse
with
the
world
not
drink
with
soldiers
not
eat
with
a
tartar
says
all
that
asked
olenin
our
teacher
but
listen
to
a
mullah
or
a
tartar
cadi
he
says
you
unbelieving
giaours
why
do
you
eat
pig
that
shows
that
everyone
has
his
own
law
but
i
think
it
all
one
god
has
made
everything
for
the
joy
of
man
there
is
no
sin
in
any
of
it
take
example
from
an
animal
it
lives
in
the
tartar
reeds
or
in
ours
wherever
it
happens
to
go
there
is
its
home
whatever
god
gives
it
that
it
eats
but
our
people
say
we
have
to
lick
plates
in
hell
for
that
and
i
think
it
all
a
fraud
he
added
after
a
pause
is
a
fraud
asked
olenin
what
the
preachers
say
we
had
an
army
captain
in
chervlena
who
was
my
kunak
a
fine
fellow
just
like
me
he
was
killed
in
chechnya
well
he
used
to
say
that
the
preachers
invent
all
that
out
of
their
own
heads
when
you
die
the
grass
will
grow
on

i
make
myself
a
perch
and
sit
there
all
night
watching
what
the
good
of
staying
at
home
one
only
gets
into
mischief
gets
drunk
and
here
women
come
and
chatter
and
boys
shout
at
me
enough
to
drive
one
mad
it
a
different
matter
when
you
go
out
at
nightfall
choose
yourself
a
place
press
down
the
reeds
and
sit
there
and
stay
waiting
like
a
jolly
fellow
one
knows
everything
that
goes
on
in
the
woods
one
looks
up
at
the
sky
the
stars
move
you
look
at
them
and
find
out
from
them
how
the
time
goes
one
looks
round
the
wood
is
rustling
one
goes
on
waiting
now
there
comes
a
crackling
a
boar
comes
to
rub
himself
one
listens
to
hear
the
young
eaglets
screech
and
then
the
cocks
give
voice
in
the
village
or
the
geese
when
you
hear
the
geese
you
know
it
is
not
yet
midnight
and
i
know
all
about
it
or
when
a
gun
is
fired
somewhere
far
away
thoughts
come
to
me
one
thinks
who
is
that
firing
is
it
another
cossack
like
myself
who
has
been
watching
for
some
animal
and
has
he
killed
it
or
only
wounded
it
so
that
now
the
poor
thing
goes
through
the
reeds
smearing
them
with
its
blood
all
for
nothing
i
do
like
that
oh
how
i
dislike
it
why
injure
a
beast
you
fool
you
fool
or
one
thinks
maybe
an
abrek
has
killed
some
silly
little
cossack
all
this
passes
through
one
mind
and
once
as
i
sat
watching
by
the
river
i
saw
a
cradle
floating
down
it
was
sound
except
for
one
corner
which
was
broken
off
thoughts
did
come
that
time
i
thought
some
of
your
soldiers
the
devils
must
have
got
into
a
tartar
village
and
seized
the
chechen
women
and
one
of
the
devils
has
killed
the
little
one
taken
it
by
its
legs
and
hit
its
head
against
a
wall
do
they
do
such
things
ah
men
have
no
souls
and
thoughts
came
to
me
that
filled
me
with
pity
i
thought
they
thrown
away
the
cradle
and
driven
the
wife
out
and
her
brave
has
taken
his
gun
and
come
across
to
our
side
to
rob
us
one
watches
and
thinks
and
when
one
hears
a
litter
breaking
through
the
thicket
something
begins
to
knock
inside
one
dear
one
come
this
way
they
scent
me
one
thinks
and
one
sits
and
does
not
stir
while
one
heart
goes
dun
dun
dun
and
simply
lifts
you
once
this
spring
a
fine
litter
came
near
me
i
saw
something
black
in
the
name
of
the
father
and
of
the
son
and
i
was
just
about
to
fire
when
she
grunts
to
her
pigs
danger
children
she
says
there
a
man
here
and
off
they
all
ran
breaking
through
the
bushes
and
she
had
been
so
close
i
could
almost
have
bitten
her
could
a
sow
tell
her
brood
that
a
man
was
there
asked
olenin
do
you
think
you
think
the
beast
a
fool
no
he
is
wiser
than
a
man
though
you
do
call
him
a
pig
he
knows
everything
take
this
for
instance
a
man
will
pass
along
your
track
and
not
notice
it
but
a
pig
as
soon
as
it
gets
onto
your
track
turns
and
runs
at
once
that
shows
there
is
wisdom
in
him
since
he
scents
your
smell
and
you
do
and
there
is
this
to
be
said
too
you
wish
to
kill
it
and
it
wishes
to
go
about
the
woods
alive
you
have
one
law
and
it
has
another
it
is
a
pig
but
it
is
no
worse
than
you
it
too
is
god
creature
ah
dear
man
is
foolish
foolish
foolish
the
old
man
repeated
this
several
times
and
then
letting
his
head
drop
he
sat
thinking
olenin
also
became
thoughtful
and
descending
from
the
porch
with
his
hands
behind
his
back
began
pacing
up
and
down
the
yard
eroshka
rousing
himself
raised
his
head
and
began
gazing
intently
at
the
moths
circling
round
the
flickering
flame
of
the
candle
and
burning
themselves
in
it
fool
he
said
are
you
flying
to
fool
fool
he
rose
and
with
his
thick
fingers
began
to
drive
away
the
moths
burn
little
fool
fly
this
way
there
plenty
of
room
he
spoke
tenderly
trying
to
catch
them
delicately
by
their
wings
with
his
thick
fingers
and
then
letting
them
fly
again
are
killing
yourself
and
i
am
sorry
for
you
he
sat
a
long
time
chattering
and
sipping
out
of
the
bottle
olenin
paced
up
and
down
the
yard
suddenly
he
was
struck
by
the
sound
of
whispering
outside
the
gate
involuntarily
holding
his
breath
he
heard
a
woman
laughter
a
man
voice
and
the
sound
of
a
kiss
intentionally
rustling
the
grass
under
his
feet
he
crossed
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
yard
but
after
a
while
the
wattle
fence
creaked
a
cossack
in
a
dark
circassian
coat
and
a
white
sheepskin
cap
passed
along
the
other
side
of
the
fence
it
was
luke
and
a
tall
woman
with
a
white
kerchief
on
her
head
went
past
olenin
and
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
one
another
was
what
maryanka
firm
step
gave
him
to
understand
he
followed
her
with
his
eyes
to
the
porch
of
the
hut
and
he
even
saw
her
through
the
window
take
off
her
kerchief
and
sit
down
and
suddenly
a
feeling
of
lonely
depression
and
some
vague
longings
and
hopes
and
envy
of
someone
or
other
overcame
the
young
man
soul
the
last
lights
had
been
put
out
in
the
huts
the
last
sounds
had
died
away
in
the
village
the
wattle
fences
and
the
cattle
gleaming
white
in
the
yards
the
roofs
of
the
houses
and
the
stately
poplars
all
seemed
to
be
sleeping
the
labourers
healthy
peaceful
sleep
only
the
incessant
ringing
voices
of
frogs
from
the
damp
distance
reached
the
young
man
in
the
east
the
stars
were
growing
fewer
and
fewer
and
seemed
to
be
melting
in
the
increasing
light
but
overhead
they
were
denser
and
deeper
than
before
the
old
man
was
dozing
with
his
head
on
his
hand
a
cock
crowed
in
the
yard
opposite
but
olenin
still
paced
up
and
down
thinking
of
something
the
sound
of
a
song
sung
by
several
voices
reached
him
and
he
stepped
up
to
the
fence
and
listened
the
voices
of
several
young
cossacks
carolled
a
merry
song
and
one
voice
was
distinguishable
among
them
all
by
its
firm
strength
you
know
who
is
singing
there
said
the
old
man
rousing
himself
is
the
brave
lukashka
he
has
killed
a
chechen
and
now
he
rejoices
and
what
is
there
to
rejoice
at
the
fool
the
fool

my

the

man
left
the
song
ceased
but
one
could
hear
footsteps
and
merry
talk
a
little
later
the
singing
broke
out
again
but
farther
away
and
eroshka
loud
voice
chimed
in
with
the
other
people

a
sigh

he
returned

chapter
xvi
daddy
eroshka
was
a
superannuated
and
solitary
cossack
twenty
years
ago
his
wife
had
gone
over
to
the
orthodox
church
and
run
away
from
him
and
married
a
russian
and
he
had
no
children
he
was
not
bragging
when
he
spoke
of
himself
as
having
been
the
boldest
in
the
village
when
he
was
young
everybody
in
the
regiment
knew
of
his
prowess
the
death
of
more
than
one
russian
as
well
as
chechen
lay
on
his
conscience
he
used
to
go
plundering
in
the
mountains
and
robbed
the
russians
too
and
he
had
twice
been
in
prison
the
greater
part
of
his
life
was
spent
in
the
forests
hunting
there
he
lived
for
days
on
a
crust
of
bread
and
drank
nothing
but
water
but
on
the
other
hand
when
he
was
in
the
village
he
made
merry
from
morning
to
night
after
leaving
olenin
he
slept
for
a
couple
of
hours
and
awoke
before
it
was
light
he
lay
on
his
bed
thinking
of
the
man
he
had
become
acquainted
with
the
evening
before
simplicity
in
the
sense
of
not
grudging
him
a
drink
pleased
him
very
much
and
so
did
olenin
himself
he
wondered
why
the
russians
were
all
and
so
rich
and
why
they
were
educated
and
yet
knew
nothing
he
pondered
on
these
questions
and
also
considered
what
he
might
get
out

hut
was
of
a
good
size
and
not
old
but
the
absence
of
a
woman
was
very
noticeable
in
it
contrary
to
the
usual
cleanliness
of
the
cossacks
the
whole
of
this
hut
was
filthy
and
exceedingly
untidy

been
thrown
on

on

corner
stood
a
tub
with
stinking
water
in
which
another
pair
of

were
being
steeped
and
near
by
was
a
gun
and
a
on
the
floor
a
net
had
been
thrown
down
and
several
dead
pheasants
lay
there

a
hen
tied
by
its
leg
was
walking
about

a
broken
pot
with
some
kind
of
milky
liquid
on
the
top
of
the

a
falcon
was
screeching
and
trying
to
break
the
cord
by
which
it
was
tied
and
a
moulting
hawk
sat
quietly
on
the
edge
of
the
oven
looking
askance
at
the
hen
and
occasionally
bowing
its

rigged
up

with
his
strong
legs
raised
and
his
feet
on

was
picking
with
his
thick

at

on

he
was
accustomed
to
carry
without
wearing

the
whole

especially
near
the

was
filled
with

strong

carried
about

to
see
daddy
on
your
way
to
the
cordon
at
the
sound
of
his
master
shout
the
hawk
flapped
his
wings
and
pulled
at
his
cord
the
old
man
was
fond
of
lukashka
who
was
the
only
man
he
excepted
from
his
general
contempt
for
the
younger
generation
of
cossacks
besides
that
lukashka
and
his
mother
as
near
neighbours
often
gave
the
old
man
wine

cream
and
other
home
produce
which
eroshka
did
not
possess
daddy
eroshka
who
all
his
life
had
allowed
himself
to
get
carried
away
always
explained
his
infatuations
from
a
practical
point
of
view
why
not
he
used
to
say
to
himself
give
them
some
fresh
meat
or
a
bird
and
they
wo
forget
daddy
sometimes
bring
a
cake
or
a
piece
of
pie
morning
mark
i
am
glad
to
see
you
shouted
the
old
man
cheerfully
and
quickly
putting
down
his
bare
feet
he
jumped
off
his
bed
and
walked
a
step
or
two
along
the
creaking
floor
looked
down
at
his
toes
and
suddenly
amused
by
the
appearance
of
his
feet
smiled
stamped
with
his
bare
heel
on
the
ground
stamped
again
and
then
performed
a
funny
clever
eh
he
asked
his
small
eyes
glistening
lukashka
smiled
faintly
back
to
the
cordon
asked
the
old
man
have
brought
the
chikhir
i
promised
you
when
we
were
at
the
cordon
christ
save
you
said
the
old
man
and
he
took
up
the
extremely
wide
trousers
that
were
lying
on
the
floor
and
his
beshmet
put
them
on
fastened
a
strap
round
his
waist
poured
some
water
from
an
earthenware
pot
over
his
hands
wiped
them
on
the
old
trousers
smoothed
his
beard
with
a
bit
of
comb
and
stopped
in
front
of
lukashka
he
said
lukashka
fetched
a
cup
wiped
it
and
filled
it
with
wine
and
then
handed
it
to
the
old
man
health
to
the
father
and
the
son
said
the
old
man
accepting
the
wine
with
solemnity
you
have
what
you
desire
may
you
always
be
a
hero
and
obtain
a
cross
lukashka
also
drank
a
little
after
repeating
a
prayer
and
then
put
the
wine
on
the
table
the
old
man
rose
and
brought
out
some
dried
fish
which
he
laid
on
the
threshold
where
he
beat
it
with
a
stick
to
make
it
tender
then
having
put
it
with
his
horny
hands
on
a
blue
plate
his
only
one
he
placed
it
on
the
table
have
all
i
want
i
have
victuals
thank
god
he
said
proudly
and
what
of
mosev
he
added
lukashka
evidently
wishing
to
know
the
old
man
opinion
told
him
how
the
officer
had
taken
the
gun
from
him
mind
the
gun
said
the
old
man
you
do
give
the
gun
you
will
get
no
reward
they
say
daddy
it
little
reward
a
fellow
gets
when
he
is
not
yet
a
mounted
cossack
and
the
gun
is
a
fine
one
a
crimean
worth
eighty
rubles
let
it
go
i
had
a
dispute
like
that
with
an
officer
he
wanted
my
horse
give
it
me
and
you
be
made
a
cornet
says
he
i
would
and
i
got
nothing
daddy
but
you
see
i
have
to
buy
a
horse
and
they
say
you
get
one
the
other
side
of
the
river
under
fifty
rubles
and
mother
has
not
yet
sold
our
wine
we
did
bother
said
the
old
man
daddy
eroshka
was
your
age
he
already
stole
herds
of
horses
from
the
nogay
folk
and
drove
them
across
the
terek
sometimes
we
give
a
fine
horse
for
a
quart
of
vodka
or
a
cloak
so
cheap
asked
lukashka
a
fool
a
fool
mark
said
the
old
man
contemptuously
that
what
one
steals
for
so
as
not
to
be
stingy
as
for
you
i
suppose
you
have
so
much
as
seen
how
one
drives
off
a
herd
of
horses
why
do
you
speak
one
to
say
daddy
replied
lukashka
seems
we
are
not
the
same
sort
of
men
as
you
were
a
fool
mark
a
fool
not
the
same
sort
of
men
retorted
the
old
man
mimicking
the
cossack
lad
was
not
that
sort
of
cossack
at
your
age
that
asked
lukashka
the
old
man
shook
his
head
contemptuously
eroshka
was
simple
he
did
not
grudge
anything
that
why
i
was
kunak
with
all
chechnya
a
kunak
would
come
to
visit
me
and
i
make
him
drunk
with
vodka
and
make
him
happy
and
put
him
to
sleep
with
me
and
when
i
went
to
see
him
i
take
him
a
present
a
dagger
that
the
way
it
is
done
and
not
as
you
do
nowadays
the
only
amusement
lads
have
now
is
to
crack
seeds
and
spit
out
the
shells
the
old
man
finished
contemptuously
imitating
the
cossacks
cracking
seeds
and
spitting
out
the
shells
i
know
said
lukashka
so
you
wish
to
be
a
fellow
of
the
right
sort
be
a
brave
and
not
a
peasant
because
even
a
peasant
can
buy
a
horse
pay
the
money
and
take
the
horse
they
were
silent
for
a
while
of
course
it
dull
both
in
the
village
and
the
cordon
daddy
but
there
nowhere
one
can
go
for
a
bit
of
sport
all
our
fellows
are
so
timid
take
nazarka
the
other
day
when
we
went
to
the
tartar
village
girey
khan
asked
us
to
come
to
nogay
to
take
some
horses
but
no
one
went
and
how
was
i
to
go
alone
what
of
daddy
do
you
think
i
am
quite
dried
up
no
i
not
dried
up
let
me
have
a
horse
and
i
be
off
to
nogay
at
once
the
good
of
talking
nonsense
said
luke
better
tell
me
what
to
do
about
girey
khan
he
says
only
bring
horses
to
the
terek
and
then
even
if
you
bring
a
whole
stud
i
find
a
place
for
them
you
see
he
also
a
tartar
how
one
to
believe
him
may
trust
girey
khan
all
his
kin
were
good
people
his
father
too
was
a
faithful
kunak
but
listen
to
daddy
and
i
wo
teach
you
wrong
make
him
take
an
oath
then
it
will
be
all
right
and
if
you
go
with
him
have
your
pistol
ready
all
the
same
especially
when
it
comes
to
dividing
up
the
horses
i
was
nearly
killed
that
way
once
by
a
chechen
i
wanted
ten
rubles
from
him
for
a
horse
trusting
is
all
right
but
do
go
to
sleep
without
a
gun
lukashka
listened
attentively
to
the
old
man
say
daddy
have
you
any
grass
he
asked
after
a
pause
i
have
any
but
i
teach
you
how
to
get
it
you
a
good
lad
and
wo

the
old
man

i
tell

tortoise
she
a
devil
the
tortoise

so
that
she
ca

round
it
and
then

go
off
to
find
the
grass
and
will
bring
some
along
and
destroy
the
fence
anyhow
next
morning
come
in
good
time
and
where
the
fence
is
broken
there
find
the
grass
lying
take
it
wherever
you
like
no
lock
and
no
bar

be
able
to
stop
you
you
tried
it
yourself
daddy
for
trying
i
have
not
tried
it
but
i
was
told
of
it
by
good
people
i
used
only
one
charm
that
was
to
repeat
the
pilgrim
rhyme
when
mounting
my
horse
and
no
one
ever
killed
me

the
pilgrim
rhyme

lukashka
laughed
daddy
was
it
that
that
hindered
their
killing
you
maybe
it
just
happened
so
grown
too
clever

no
harm

sung
pilgrim

the
old
man
himself
began
laughing
just
one
thing
luke
you
go
to
nogay
have
changed
you

not
the
same

just
as
if

girchik
and
i
we
used
and
the
old
man
was
about
to
begin
one
of
his
endless
tales
but
lukashka
glanced
at
the
window
and
interrupted
him
is
quite
light

to

good
fellow
chapter
xvii
from
eroshka
hut
lukashka
went
home
as
he
returned
the
dewy
mists
were
rising
from
the
ground
and
enveloped
the
village
in
various
places
the
cattle
though
out
of
sight
could
be
heard
beginning
to
stir
the
cocks
called
to
one
another
with
increasing
frequency
and
insistence
the
air
was
becoming
more
transparent
and
the
villagers
were
getting
up
not
till
he
was
close
to
it
could
lukishka
discern
the
fence
of
his
yard
all
wet
with
dew
the
porch
of
the
hut
and
the
open
shed
from
the
misty
yard
he
heard
the
sound
of
an
axe
chopping
wood
lukashka
entered
the
hut
his
mother
was
up
and
stood
at
the
oven
throwing
wood
into
it
his
little
sister
was
still
lying
in
bed
asleep
lukashka
had
enough
asked
his
mother
softly
did
you
spend
the
night
was
in
the
village
replied
her
son
reluctantly
reaching
for
his
musket
which
he
drew
from
its
cover
and
examined
carefully
his
mother
swayed
her
head
lukashka
poured
a
little
gunpowder
onto
the
pan
took
out
a
little
bag
from
which
he
drew
some
empty
cartridge
cases
which
he
began
filling
carefully
plugging
each
one
with
a
ball
wrapped
in
a
rag
then
having
tested
the
loaded
cartridges
with
his
teeth
and
examined
them
he
put
down
the
bag
say
mother
i
told
you
the
bags
wanted
mending
have
they
been
done
he
asked
yes
our
dumb
girl
was
mending
something
last
night
why
is
it
time
for
you
to
be
going
back
to
the
cordon
i
have
seen
anything
of
you
as
soon
as
i
have
got
ready
i
shall
have
to
go
answered
lukashka
tying
up
the
gunpowder
where
is
our
dumb
one
outside
wood
i
expect
she
kept
fretting
for
you
i
shall
not
see
him
at
all
she
said
she
puts
her
hand
to
her
face
like
this
and
clicks
her
tongue
and
presses
her
hands
to
her
heart
as
much
as
to
say
sorry
shall
i
call
her
in
she
understood
all
about
the
abrek
her
said
lukashka
i
had
some
tallow
there
bring
it
i
must
grease
my
sword
the
old
woman
went
out
and
a
few
minutes
later
lukashka
dumb
sister
came
up
the
creaking
steps
and
entered
the
hut
she
was
six
years
older
than
her
brother
and
would
have
been
extremely
like
him
had
it
not
been
for
the
dull
and
coarsely
changeable
expression
common
to
all
deaf
and
dumb
people
of
her
face
she
wore
a
coarse
smock
all
patched
her
feet
were
bare
and
muddy
and
on
her
head
she
had
an
old
blue
kerchief
her
neck
arms
and
face
were
sinewy
like
a
peasant
her
clothing
and
her
whole
appearance
indicated
that
she
always
did
the
hard
work
of
a
man
she
brought
in
a
heap
of
logs
which
she
threw
down
by
the
oven
then
she
went
up
to
her
brother
and
with
a
joyful
smile
which
made
her
whole
face
pucker
up
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
and
began
making
rapid
signs
to
him
with
her
hands
her
face
and
whole
body
right
that
right
stepka
is
a
trump
answered
the
brother
nodding
fetched
everything
and
mended
everything
she
a
trump
here
take
this
for
it
he
brought
out
two
pieces
of
gingerbread
from
his
pocket
and
gave
them
to
her
the
dumb
woman
face
flushed
with
pleasure
and
she
began
making
a
weird
noise
for
joy
having
seized
the
gingerbread
she
began
to
gesticulate
still
more
rapidly
frequently
pointing
in
one
direction
and
passing
her
thick
finger
over
her
eyebrows
and
her
face
lukashka
understood
her
and
kept
nodding
while
he
smiled
slightly
she
was
telling
him
to
give
the
girls
dainties
and
that
the
girls
liked
him
and
that
one
girl
maryanka
the
best
of
them
all
loved
him
she
indicated
maryanka
by
rapidly
pointing
in
the
direction
of
home
and
to
her
own
eyebrows
and
face
and
by
smacking
her
lips
and
swaying
her
head
she
expressed
by
pressing
her
hands
to
her
breast
kissing
her
hand
and
pretending
to
embrace
someone
their
mother
returned
to
the
hut
and
seeing
what
her
dumb
daughter
was
saying
smiled
and
shook
her
head
her
daughter
showed
her
the
gingerbread
and
again
made
the
noise
which
expressed
joy
told
ulitka
the
other
day
that
i
send
a
matchmaker
to
them
said
the
mother
took
my
words
well
lukashka
looked
silently
at
his
mother
how
about
selling
the
wine

need
a
horse
cart

said
the
mother
evidently
not
wishing
her
son
to
meddle
in
domestic
matters
you
go
out
you
find
a
bag
in
the
passage

borrowed
from
the
neighbours
and

something
for

cordon
or

lukashka

at
the

began
to
get
ready
to
start

said
the
old
woman
seems
you

been
spreeing
at
yamka
all
the
time
i
went
out
in
the
night
to
see
the
cattle
and
i
think
it
was
your
voice
i
heard
singing
songs
lukashka
did
not
reply
but
went
out
into
the
passage
threw
the
bags
over
his
shoulder
tucked
up
the
skirts
of
his
coat
took
his
musket
and
then
stopped
for
a
moment
on
the
threshold
mother
he
said
as
he
closed
the
gate
behind
him
me
a
small
barrel
with
nazarka
i
promised
it
to
the

new
barrel
said
the
old
woman
going
to
the
fence
listen
she
added
leaning
over
the
fence
the
cossack
stopped
been
making
merry
here
well
that
all
right
why
should
not
a
young
man
amuse
himself
god

the
girl

all
right
answered
her
son
frowning
his
deaf
sister
shouted
to
attract
his
attention
she
pointed
to
her
head
and
the
palm
of
her
hand
to
indicate
the
shaved
head
of
a
chechen
then
she
frowned
and
pretending
to
aim
with
a
gun
she
shrieked
and
began
rapidly
humming
and
shaking
her
head
this
meant
that
lukashka
should
kill
another
chechen
lukashka
understood
he
smiled
and
shifting
the
gun
at
his
back
under
his
cloak
stepped
lightly
and
rapidly
and
soon
disappeared
in
the
thick
mist
the
old
woman
having
stood
a
little
while
at
the
gate
returned
silently
to
the
hut
and
immediately
began
working

lukasha
returned
to
the
cordon
and
at
the
same
time
daddy
eroshka
whistled
to
his
dogs
and
climbing
over
his
wattle
fence
went
to
olenin
lodging
passing
by
the
back
of
the
houses
he
disliked
meeting
women
before
going
out
hunting
or
shooting
he
found
olenin
still
asleep
and
even
vanyusha
though
awake
was
still
in
bed
and
looking
round
the
room
considering
whether
it
was
not
time
to
get
up
when
daddy
eroshka
gun
on

and
in
full
hunter

opened

she
going
for

and
you
still
sleeping
olenin
awoke
and
jumped
up
feeling
fresh
and
lighthearted
at
the
sight
of
the
old
man
and
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
vanyusha
quick
he
cried
that
the
way
you
go
hunting
said
the
old
man

having
their
breakfast
and
you

he
called
to
his
dog

gun

he
shouted
as
loud
as
if
a
whole
crowd
were
in
the
hut
it
true
i
guilty
but

ca

man
shouted
at
vanyusha
showing
the
stumps
of
his
teeth

said
olenin
playfully
drawing
on
his
high
boots
first
offence

be

answered
eroshka
if

of

when
it

olenin
repeating
the
words
spoken
by
the
old
man
the
evening
before
you
ca
deceive
him
laugh
away
you
kill
one
first
and
then
you
may

now
then
hurry
up
look
there
the
master
himself
coming
to
see
you
added
eroshka
looking
out
of
the
window
see
how
he
got
himself
up
he
put
on
a
new
coat
so
that
you
should
see
that
he
an
officer
ah
these
people
these
people
sure
enough
vanyusha
came
in
and
announced
that
the
master
of
the
house
wished
to
see
olenin
he
remarked
profoundly
to
forewarn
his
master
of
the
meaning
of
this
visitation
following
him
the
master
of
the
house
in
a
new
circassian
coat
with
an
officer
stripes
on
the
shoulders
and
with
polished
boots
quite
exceptional
among
cossacks
entered
the
room
swaying
from
side
to
side
and
congratulated
his
lodger
on
his
safe
arrival
the
cornet
elias
vasilich
was
an
educated
cossack
he
had
been
to
russia
proper
was
a
regimental
schoolteacher
and
above
all
he
was
noble
he
wished
to
appear
noble
but
one
could
not
help
feeling
beneath
his
grotesque
pretence
of
polish
his
affectation
his
and
his
absurd
way
of
speaking
he
was
just
the
same
as
daddy
eroshka
this
could
also
be
clearly
seen
by
his
sunburnt
face
and
his
hands
and
his
red
nose
olenin
asked
him
to
sit
down
morning
father
elias
vasilich
said
eroshka
rising
with
or
so
it
seemed
to
olenin
an
ironically
low
bow
morning
daddy
so
you
here
already
said
the
cornet
with
a
careless
nod
the
cornet
was
a
man
of
about
forty
with
a
grey
pointed
beard
skinny
and
lean
but
handsome
and
very
for
his
age
having
come
to
see
olenin
he
was
evidently
afraid
of
being
taken
for
an
ordinary
cossack
and
wanted
to
let
olenin
feel
his
importance
from
the
first
our
egyptian
nimrod
he
remarked
addressing
olenin
and
pointing
to
the
old
man
with
a
smile
mighty
hunter
before
the
lord
he
our
foremost
man
on
every
hand
you
already
been
pleased
to
get
acquainted
with
him
daddy
eroshka
gazed
at
his
feet
in
their
shoes
of
wet
raw
hide
and
shook
his
head
thoughtfully
at
the
cornet
ability
and
learning
and
muttered
to
himself
nimvrod
what
things
he
invents
you
see
we
mean
to
go
hunting
answered
olenin
sir
exactly
said
the
cornet
i
have
a
small
business
with
you
do
you
want
that
you
are
a
gentleman
began
the
cornet
as
i
may
understand
myself
to
be
in
the
rank
of
an
officer
too
and
therefore
we
may
always
progressively
negotiate
as
gentlemen
do
he
stopped
and
looked
with
a
smile
at
olenin
and
at
the
old
man
if
you
have
the
desire
with
my
consent
then
as
my
wife
is
a
foolish
woman
of
our
class
she
could
not
quite
comprehend
your
words
of
yesterday
date
therefore
my
quarters
might
be
let
for
six
rubles
to
the
regimental
adjutant
without
the
stables
but
i
can
always
avert
that
from
myself
free
of
charge
but
as
you
desire
therefore
i
being
myself
of
an
officer
rank
can
come
to
an
agreement
with
you
in
everything
personally
as
an
inhabitant
of
this
district
not
according
to
our
customs
but
can
maintain
the
conditions
in
every
way
clearly
muttered
the
old
man
the
cornet
continued
in
the
same
strain
for
a
long
time
at
last
not
without
difficulty
olenin
gathered
that
the
cornet
wished
to
let
his
rooms
to
him
olenin
for
six
rubles
a
month
the
latter
gladly
agreed
to
this
and
offered
his
visitor
a
glass
of
tea
the
cornet
declined
it
to
our
silly
custom
we
consider
it
a
sort
of
sin
to
drink
out
of
a
worldly
tumbler
he
said
of
course
with
my
education
i
may
understand
but
my
wife
from
her
human
weakness
then
will
you
have
some
tea
you
will
permit
me
i
will
bring
my
own
particular
glass
answered
the
cornet
and
stepped
out
into
the
porch
me
my
glass
he
cried
in
a
few
minutes
the
door
opened
and
a
young
sunburnt
arm
in
a
print
sleeve
thrust
itself
in
holding
a
tumbler
in
the
hand
the
cornet
went
up
took
it
and
whispered
something
to
his
daughter
olenin
poured
tea
for
the
cornet
into
the
latter
own
glass
and
for
eroshka
into
a
glass
i
do
not
desire
to
detain
you
said
the
cornet
scalding
his
lips
and
emptying
his
tumbler
too
have
a
great
liking
for
fishing
and
i
am
here
so
to
say
only
on
leave
of
absence
for
recreation
from
my
duties
i
too
have
the
desire
to
tempt
fortune
and
see
whether
some
gifts
of
the
terek
may
not
fall
to
my
share
i
hope
you
too
will
come
and
see
us
and
have
a
drink
of
our
wine
according
to
the
custom
of
our
village
he
added
the
cornet
bowed
shook
hands
with
olenin
and
went
out
while
olenin
was
getting
ready
he
heard
the
cornet
giving
orders
to
his
family
in
an
authoritative
and
sensible
tone
and
a
few
minutes
later
he
saw
him
pass
by
the
window
in
a
tattered
coat
with
his
trousers
rolled
up
to
his
knees
and
a
fishing
net
over
his
shoulder
rascal
said
daddy
eroshka
emptying
his
tumbler
will
you
really
pay
him
six
rubles
was
such
a
thing
ever
heard
of
they
would
let
you
the
best
hut
in
the
village
for
two
rubles
what
a
beast
why
i
let
you
have
mine
for
three
i
remain
here
said
olenin
rubles
clearly
it
a
fool
money
eh
eh
eh
answered
the
old
man
have
some
chikhir
ivan
having
had
a
snack
and
a
drink
of
vodka
to
prepare
themselves
for
the
road
olenin
and
the
old
man
went
out
together
before
eight
at
the
gate
they
came
up
against
a
wagon
to
which
a
pair
of
oxen
were
harnessed
with
a
white
kerchief
tied
round
her
head
down
to
her
eyes
a
coat
over
her
smock
and
wearing
high
boots
maryanka
with
a
long
switch
in
her
hand
was
dragging
the
oxen
by
a
cord
tied
to
their
horns
said
the
old
man
pretending
that
he
was
going
to
seize
her
maryanka
flourished
her
switch
at
him
and
glanced
merrily
at
them
both
with
her
beautiful
eyes
olenin
felt
still
more
then
come
on
come
on
he
said
throwing
his
gun
on
his
shoulder
and
conscious
of
the
girl
eyes
upon

burst
out
laughing
himself
it
mark

is
luke
but
i
call
him
mark
for
a
joke
his
very
self
i
love
him
i
was
just
such
a
one
myself
what
the
good
of
minding
them
my
sweetheart
used
to
sleep
with
her
mother
and
her
but
i
managed
to
get
in
she
used
to
sleep
upstairs
that
witch
her
mother
was
a
regular
demon
it
awful
how
she
hated
me
well
i
used
to
come
with
a
chum
girchik
his
name
was
we
come
under
her
window
and
climb
on
his
shoulders
push
up
the
window
and
begin
groping
about
she
used
to
sleep
just
there
on
a
bench
once
i
woke
her
up
and
she
nearly
called
out
she
had
recognized
me
who
is
there
she
said
and
i
could
not
answer
her
mother
was
even
beginning
to
stir
but
i
took
off
my
cap
and
shoved
it
over
her
mouth
and
she
at
once
knew
it
by
a
seam
in
it
and
ran
out
to
me
i
used
not
to
want
anything
then
she
bring
along
clotted
cream
and
grapes
and
everything
added
eroshka
who
always
explained
things
practically
she
was
the
only
one
it
was
a
life
what
now
we
follow
the
dog
get
a
pheasant
to
settle
on
a
tree
and
then
you
may
fire
you
have
made
up
to
maryanka
to
the
dogs
i
tell
you
tonight
said
the
old
man
pointing
to
his
favourite
dog
lyam
after
a
pause
they
continued
talking
while
they
went
about
a
hundred
paces
then
the
old
man
stopped
again
and
pointed
to
a
twig
that
lay
across
the
path
do
you
think
of
that
he
said
think
it
nothing
it
bad
that
this
stick
is
lying
so
is
it
bad
he
smiled
you
do
know
anything
just
listen
to
me
when
a
stick
lies
like
that
do
you
step
across
it
but
go
round
it
or
throw
it
off
the
path
this
way
and
say
father
and
son
and
holy
ghost
and
then
go
on
with
god
blessing
nothing
will
happen
to
you
that
what
the
old
men
used
to
teach
me
what
rubbish
said
olenin
better
tell
me
more
about
maryanka
does
she
carry
on
with
lukashka
be
quiet
now
the
old
man
again
interrupted
in
a
whisper
listen
we
go
round
through
the
forest
and
the
old
man
stepping
quietly
in
his
soft
shoes
led
the
way
by
a
narrow
path
leading
into
the
dense
wild
overgrown
forest
now
and
again
with
a
frown
he
turned
to
look
at
olenin
who
rustled
and
clattered
with
his
heavy
boots
and
carrying
his
gun
carelessly
several
times
caught
the
twigs
of
trees
that
grew
across
the
path
make
a
noise
step
softly
soldier
the
old
man
whispered
angrily
there
was
a
feeling
in
the
air
that
the
sun
had
risen
the
mist
was
dissolving
but
it
still
enveloped
the
tops
of
the
trees
the
forest
looked
terribly
high
at
every
step
the
aspect
changed
what
had
appeared
like
a
tree
proved
to
be
a
bush
and
a
reed
looked
like
a
tree
chapter
xix
the
mist
had
partly
lifted
showing
the
wet
reed
thatches
and
was
now
turning
into
dew
that
moistened
the
road
and
the
grass
beside
the
fence
smoke
rose
everywhere
in
clouds
from
the
chimneys
the
people
were
going
out
of
the
village
some
to
their
work
some
to
the
river
and
some
to
the
cordon
the
hunters
walked
together
along
the
damp
path
the
dogs
wagging
their
tails
and
looking
at
their
masters
ran
on
both
sides
of
them
myriads
of
gnats
hovered
in
the
air
and
pursued
the
hunters
covering
their
backs
eyes
and
hands
the
air
was
fragrant
with
the
grass
and
with
the
dampness
of
the
forest
olenin
continually
looked
round
at
the
in
which
maryanka
sat
urging
on
the
oxen
with
a
long
switch
it
was
calm
the
sounds
from
the
village
audible
at
first
now
no
longer
reached
the
sportsmen
only
the
brambles
cracked
as
the
dogs
ran
under
them
and
now
and
then
birds
called
to
one
another
olenin
knew
that
danger
lurked
in
the
forest
that
abreks
always
hid
in
such
places
but
he
knew
too
that
in
the
forest
for
a
man
on
foot
a
gun
is
a
great
protection
not
that
he
was
afraid
but
he
felt
that
another
in
his
place
might
be
and
looking
into
the
damp
misty
forest
and
listening
to
the
rare
and
faint
sounds
with
strained
attention
he
changed
his
hold
on
his
gun
and
experienced
a
pleasant
feeling
that
was
new
to
him
daddy
eroshka
went
in
front
stopping
and
carefully
scanning
every
puddle
where
an
animal
had
left
a
double
track
and
pointing
it
out
to
olenin
he
hardly
spoke
at
all
and
only
occasionally
made
remarks
in
a
whisper
the
track
they
were
following
had
once
been
made
by
wagons
but
the
grass
had
long
overgrown
it
the
elm
and
forest
on
both
sides
of
them
was
so
dense
and
overgrown
with
creepers
that
it
was
impossible
to
see
anything
through
it
nearly
every
tree
was
enveloped
from
top
to
bottom
with
wild
grape
vines
and
dark
bramble
bushes
covered
the
ground
thickly
every
little
glade
was
overgrown
with
blackberry
bushes
and
grey
feathery
reeds
in
places
large
and
small
led
from
the
path
into
the
thicket
the
vigour
of
the
growth
of
this
forest
untrampled
by
cattle
struck
olenin
at
every
turn
for
he
had
never
seen
anything
like
it
this
forest
the
danger
the
old
man
and
his
mysterious
whispering
maryanka
with
her
virile
upright
bearing
and
the
mountains
all
this
seemed
to
him
like
a
dream
pheasant
has
settled
whispered
the
old
man
looking
round
and
pulling
his
cap
over
his
face
your
mug
a
pheasant
he
waved
his
arm
angrily
at
olenin
and
pushed
forward
almost
on
all
fours
do
like
a
man
mug
olenin
was
still
behind
him
when
the
old
man
stopped
and
began
examining
a
tree
a
on
the
tree
clucked
at
the
dog
that
was
barking
at
it
and
olenin
saw
the
pheasant
but
at
that
moment
a
report
as
of
a
cannon
came
from
eroshka
enormous
gun
the
bird
fluttered
up
and
losing
some
feathers
fell
to
the
ground
coming
up
to
the
old
man
olenin
disturbed
another
and
raising
his
gun
he
aimed
and
fired
the
pheasant
flew
swiftly
up
and
then
catching
at
the
branches
as
he
fell
dropped
like
a
stone
to
the
ground
man
the
old
man
who
could
not
hit
a
flying
bird
shouted
laughing
having
picked
up
the
pheasants
they
went
on
olenin
excited
by
the
exercise
and
the
praise
kept
addressing
remarks
to
the
old
man
come
this
way
the
old
man
interrupted
noticed
the
track
of
deer
here
yesterday
after
they
had
turned
into
the
thicket
and
gone
some
three
hundred
paces
they
scrambled
through
into
a
glade
overgrown
with
reeds
and
partly
under
water
olenin
failed
to
keep
up
with
the
old
huntsman
and
presently
daddy
eroshka
some
twenty
paces
in
front
stooped
down
nodding
and
beckoning
with
his
arm
on
coming
up
with
him
olenin
saw
a
man

to
which
the

was
pointing

well
said
olenin
trying
to
speak
as
calmly
as
he
could
man
footstep
involuntarily
a
thought
of
cooper
pathfinder
and
of
abreks
flashed
through
olenin
mind
but
noticing
the
mysterious
manner
with
which
the
old
man
moved
on
he
hesitated
to
question
him
and
remained
in
doubt
whether
this
mysteriousness
was
caused
by
fear
of
danger
or
by
the
sport
it
my
own
footprint
the
old
man
said
quietly
and
pointed
to
some
grass
under
which
the
track
of
an
animal
was
just
perceptible
the
old
man
went
on
and
olenin
kept
up
with
him
descending
to
lower
ground
some
twenty
paces
farther
on
they
came
upon
a
spreading
under
which
on
the
black
earth
lay
the
fresh
dung
of
some
animal
the
spot
all
covered
over
with
wild
vines
was
like
a
cosy
arbour
dark
and
cool
been
here
this
morning
said
the
old
man
with
a
sigh
lair
is
still
damp
quite
fresh
suddenly
they
heard
a
terrible
crash
in
the
forest
some
ten
paces
from
where
they
stood
they
both
started
and
seized
their
guns
but
they
could
see
nothing
and
only
heard
the
branches
breaking
the
rhythmical
rapid
thud
of
galloping
was
heard
for
a
moment
and
then
changed
into
a
hollow
rumble
which
resounded
farther
and
farther
off
in
wider
and
wider
circles
through
the
forest
olenin
felt
as
though
something
had
snapped
in
his
heart
he
peered
carefully
but
vainly
into
the
green
thicket
and
then
turned
to
the
old
man
daddy
eroshka
with
his
gun
pressed
to
his
breast
stood
motionless
his
cap
was
thrust
backwards
his
eyes
gleamed
with
an
unwonted
glow
and
his
open
mouth
with
its
worn
yellow
teeth
seemed
to
have
stiffened
in
that
position
homed
stag
he
muttered
and
throwing
down
his
gun
in
despair
he
began
pulling
at
his
grey
beard
it
stood
we
should
have
come
round
by
the
path

and
he
gave
his
beard
an
angry
tug
fool
pig
he
repeated
pulling
painfully
at
his
own
beard
through
the
forest
something
seemed
to
fly
away
in
the
mist
and
ever
farther
and
farther
off
was
heard
the
sound
of
the
flight
of
the
stag
it
was
already
dusk
when
hungry
tired

full
of

dinner
was

he
ate
and
drank
with
the

till
he
felt
warm
and
merry

then
went
out
into
the
porch
again
to
the
west
the
mountains
rose
before
his
eyes
again
the
old

told
his
endless
stories

and
of
all
that

across

went
alone
to
the
spot
where
he
and
the
old
man
startled
the
stag
instead
of
passing
round
through
the
gate
he
climbed
over
the
prickly
hedge
as
everybody
else
did
and
before
he
had
had
time
to
pull
out
the
thorns
that
had
caught
in
his
coat
his
dog
which
had
run
on
in
front
started
two
pheasants
he
had
hardly
stepped
among
the
briers
when
the
pheasants
began
to
rise
at
every
step
the
old
man
had
not
shown
him
that
place
the
day
before
as
he
meant
to
keep
it
for
shooting
from
behind
the
screen
olenin
fired
twelve
times
and
killed
five
pheasants
but
clambering
after
them
through
the
briers
he
got
so
fatigued
that
he
was
drenched
with
perspiration
he
called
off
his
dog
uncocked
his
gun
put
in
a
bullet
above
the
small
shot
and
brushing
away
the
mosquitoes
with
the
wide
sleeve
of
his
circassian
coat
he
went
slowly
to
the
spot
where
they
had
been
the
day
before
it
was
however
impossible
to
keep
back
the
dog
who
found
trails
on
the
very
path
and
olenin
killed
two
more
pheasants
so
that
after
being
detained
by
this
it
was
getting
towards
noon
before
he
began
to
find
the
place
he
was
looking
for
the
day
was
perfectly
clear
calm
and
hot
the
morning
moisture
had
dried
up
even
in
the
forest
and
myriads
of
mosquitoes
literally
covered
his
face
his
back
and
his
arms
his
dog
had
turned
from
black
to
grey
its
back
being
covered
with
mosquitoes
and
so
had
coat
through
which
the
insects
thrust
their
stings
olenin
was
ready
to
run
away
from
them
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
it
was
impossible
to
live
in
this
country
in
the
summer
he
was
about
to
go
home
but
remembering
that
other
people
managed
to
endure
such
pain
he
resolved
to
bear
it
and
gave
himself
up
to
be
devoured
and
strange
to
say
by
noontime
the
feeling
became
actually
pleasant
he
even
felt
that
without
this
atmosphere
around
him
and
that
mingled
with
perspiration
which
his
hand
smeared
over
his
face
and
that
unceasing
irritation
all
over
his
body
the
forest
would
lose
for
him
some
of
its
character
and
charm
these
myriads
of
insects
were
so
well
suited
to
that
monstrously
lavish
wild
vegetation
these
multitudes
of
birds
and
beasts
which
filled
the
forest
this
dark
foliage
this
hot
scented
air
these
runlets
filled
with
turbid
water
which
everywhere
soaked
through
from
the
terek
and
gurgled
here
and
there
under
the
overhanging
leaves
that
the
very
thing
which
had
at
first
seemed
to
him
dreadful
and
intolerable
now
seemed
pleasant
after
going
round
the
place
where
yesterday
they
had
found
the
animal
and
not
finding
anything
he
felt
inclined
to
rest
the
sun
stood
right
above
the
forest
and
poured
its
perpendicular
rays
down
on
his
back
and
head
whenever
he
came
out
into
a
glade
or
onto
the
road
the
seven
heavy
pheasants
dragged
painfully
at
his
waist
having
found
the
traces
of
yesterday
stag
he
crept
under
a
bush
into
the
thicket
just
where
the
stag
had
lain
and
lay
down
in
its
lair
he
examined
the
dark
foliage
around
him
the
place
marked
by
the
stag
perspiration
and
dung
the
imprint
of
the
stag
knees
the
bit
of
black
earth
it
had
kicked
up
and
his
own
footprints
of
the
day
before
he
felt
cool
and
comfortable
and
did
not
think
of
or
wish
for
anything
and
suddenly
he
was
overcome
by
such
a
strange
feeling
of
causeless
joy
and
of
love
for
everything
that
from
an
old
habit
of
his
childhood
he
began
crossing
himself
and
thanking
someone
suddenly
with
extraordinary
clearness
he
thought
am
i
dmitri
olenin
a
being
quite
distinct
from
every
other
being
now
lying
all
alone
heaven
only
knows
where
where
a
stag
used
to
live
an
old
stag
a
beautiful
stag
who
perhaps
had
never
seen
a
man
and
in
a
place
where
no
human
being
has
ever
sat
or
thought
these
thoughts
here
i
sit
and
around
me
stand
old
and
young
trees
one
of
them
festooned
with
wild
grape
vines
and
pheasants
are
fluttering
driving
one
another
about
and
perhaps
scenting
their
murdered
brothers
he
felt
his
pheasants
examined
them
and
wiped
the
warm
blood
off
his
hand
onto
his
coat
the
jackals
scent
them
and
with
dissatisfied
faces
go
off
in
another
direction
above
me
flying
in
among
the
leaves
which
to
them
seem
enormous
islands
mosquitoes
hang
in
the
air
and
buzz
one
two
three
four
a
hundred
a
thousand
a
million
mosquitoes
and
all
of
them
buzz
something
or
other
and
each
one
of
them
is
separate
from
all
else
and
is
just
such
a
separate
dmitri
olenin
as
i
am
myself
he
vividly
imagined
what
the
mosquitoes
buzzed
way
this
way
lads
here
some
one
we
can
eat
they
buzzed
and
stuck
to
him
and
it
was
clear
to
him
that
he
was
not
a
russian
nobleman
a
member
of
moscow
society
the
friend
and
relation
of
and
but
just
such
a
mosquito
or
pheasant
or
deer
as
those
that
were
now
living
all
around
him
as
they
just
as
daddy
eroshka
i
shall
live
awhile
and
die
and
as
he
says
truly
grass
will
grow
and
nothing
more
what
though
the
grass
does
grow
he
continued
thinking
i
must
live
and
be
happy
because
happiness
is
all
i
desire
never
mind
what
i
am
an
animal
like
all
the
rest
above
whom
the
grass
will
grow
and
nothing
more
or
a
frame
in
which
a
bit
of
the
one
god
has
been
set
still
i
must
live
in
the
very
best
way
how
then
must
i
live
to
be
happy
and
why
was
i
not
happy
before
and
he
began
to
recall
his
former
life
and
he
felt
disgusted
with
himself
he
appeared
to
himself
to
have
been
terribly
exacting
and
selfish
though
he
now
saw
that
all
the
while
he
really
needed
nothing
for
himself
and
he
looked
round
at
the
foliage
with
the
light
shining
through
it
at
the
setting
sun
and
the
clear
sky
and
he
felt
just
as
happy
as
before
am
i
happy
and
what
used
i
to
live
for
thought
he
much
i
exacted
for
myself
how
i
schemed
and
did
not
manage
to
gain
anything
but
shame
and
sorrow
and
there
now
i
require
nothing
to
be
happy
and
suddenly
a
new
light
seemed
to
reveal
itself
to
him
is
this
he
said
to
himself
lies
in
living
for
others
that
is
evident
the
desire
for
happiness
is
innate
in
every
man
therefore
it
is
legitimate
when
trying
to
satisfy
it
selfishly
that
is
by
seeking
for
oneself
riches
fame
comforts
or
love
it
may
happen
that
circumstances
arise
which
make
it
impossible
to
satisfy
these
desires
it
follows
that
it
is
these
desires
that
are
illegitimate
but
not
the
need
for
happiness
but
what
desires
can
always
be
satisfied
despite
external
circumstances
what
are
they
love
he
was
so
glad
and
excited
when
he
had
discovered
this
as
it
seemed
to
him
new
truth
that
he
jumped
up
and
began
impatiently
seeking
some
one
to
sacrifice
himself
for
to
do
good
to
and
to
love
one
wants
nothing
for
oneself
he
kept
thinking
not
live
for
others
he
took
up
his
gun
with
the
intention
of
returning
home
quickly
to
think
this
out
and
to
find
an
opportunity
of
doing
good
he
made
his
way
out
of
the
thicket
when
he
had
come
out
into
the
glade
he
looked
around
him
the
sun
was
no
longer
visible
above
the
it
had
grown
cooler
and
the
place
seemed
to
him
quite
strange
and
not
like
the
country
round
the
village
everything
seemed
changed
the
weather
and
the
character
of
the
forest
the
sky
was
wrapped
in
clouds
the
wind
was
rustling
in
the
and
all
around
nothing
was
visible
but
reeds
and
dying
trees
he
called
to
his
dog
who
had
run
away
to
follow
some
animal
and
his
voice
came
back
as
in
a
desert
and
suddenly
he
was
seized
with
a
terrible
sense
of
weirdness
he
grew
frightened
he
remembered
the
abreks
and
the
murders
he
had
been
told
about
and
he
expected
every
moment
that
an
abrek
would
spring
from
behind
every
bush
and
he
would
have
to
defend
his
life
and
die
or
be
a
coward
he
thought
of
god
and
of
the
future
life
as
for
long
he
had
not
thought
about
them
and
all
around
was
that
same
gloomy
stern
wild
nature
is
it
worth
while
living
for
oneself
thought
he
at
any
moment
you
may
die
and
die
without
having
done
any
good
and
so
that
no
one
will
know
of
it
he
went
in
the
direction
where
he
fancied
the
village
lay
of
his
shooting
he
had
no
further
thought
but
he
felt
tired
to
death
and
peered
round
at
every
bush
and
tree
with
particular
attention
and
almost
with
terror
expecting
every
moment
to
be
called
to
account
for
his
life
after
having
wandered
about
for
a
considerable
time
he
came
upon
a
ditch
down
which
was
flowing
cold
sandy
water
from
the
terek
and
not
to
go
astray
any
longer
he
decided
to
follow
it
he
went
on
without
knowing
where
the
ditch
would
lead
him
suddenly
the
reeds
behind
him
crackled
he
shuddered
and
seized
his
gun
and
then
felt
ashamed
of
himself
the
dog
panting
hard
had
thrown
itself
into
the
cold
water
of
the
ditch
and
was
lapping
it
he
too
had
a
drink
and
then
followed
the
dog
in
the
direction
it
wished
to
go
thinking
it
would
lead
him
to
the
village
but
despite
the
dog
company
everything
around
him
seemed
still
more
dreary
the
forest
grew
darker
and
the
wind
grew
stronger
and
stronger
in
the
tops
of
the
broken
old
trees
some
large
birds
circled
screeching
round
their
nests
in
those
trees
the
vegetation
grew
poorer
and
he
came
oftener
and
oftener
upon
rustling
reeds
and
bare
sandy
spaces
covered
with
animal
footprints
to
the
howling
of
the
wind
was
added
another
kind
of
cheerless
monotonous
roar
altogether
his
spirits
became
gloomy
putting
his
hand
behind
him
he
felt
his
pheasants
and
found
one
missing
it
had
broken
off
and
was
lost
and
only
the
bleeding
head
and
beak
remained
sticking
in
his
belt
he
felt
more
frightened
than
he
had
ever
done
before
he
began
to
pray
to
god
and
feared
above
all
that
he
might
die
without
having
done
anything
good
or
kind
and
he
so
wanted
to
live
and
to
live
so
as
to
perform
a
feat
of
chapter
xxi
suddenly
it
was
as
though
the
sun
had
shone
into
his
soul
he
heard
russian
being
spoken
and
also
heard
the
rapid
smooth
flow
of
the
terek
and
a
few
steps
farther
in
front
of
him
saw
the
brown
moving
surface
of
the
river
with
the
wet
sand
of
its
banks
and
shallows
the
distant
steppe
the
cordon
outlined
above
the
water
a
saddled
and
hobbled
horse
among
the
brambles
and
then
the
mountains
opening
out
before
him
the
red
sun
appeared
for
an
instant
from
under
a
cloud
and
its
last
rays
glittered
brightly
along
the
river
over
the
reeds
on
the
and
on
a
group
of
cossacks
among
whom
lukashka
vigorous
figure
attracted
olenin
involuntary
attention
olenin
felt
that
he
was
again
without
any
apparent
cause
perfectly
happy
he
had
come
upon
the
post
on
the
terek
opposite
a
tartar
village
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
he
accosted
the
cossacks
but
not
finding
as
yet
any
excuse
for
doing
anyone
a
kindness
he
entered
the
hut
nor
in
the
hut
did
he
find
any
such
opportunity
the
cossacks
received
him
coldly
on
entering
the
mud
hut
he
lit
a
cigarette
the
cossacks
paid
little
attention
to
him
first
because
he
was
smoking
a
cigarette
and
secondly
because
they
had
something
else
to
divert
them
that
evening
some
hostile
chechens
relatives
of
the
abrek
who
had
been
killed
had
come
from
the
hills
with
a
scout
to
ransom
the
body
and
the
cossacks
were
waiting
for
their
commanding
officer
arrival
from
the
village
the
dead
brother
tall
and
well
shaped
with
a
short
cropped
beard
which
was
dyed
red
despite
his
very
tattered
coat
and
cap
was
calm
and
majestic
as
a
king
his
face
was
very
like
that
of
the
dead
abrek
he
did
not
deign
to
look
at
anyone
and
never
once
glanced
at
the
dead
body
but
sitting
on
his
heels
in
the
shade
he
spat
as
he
smoked
his
short
pipe
and
occasionally
uttered
some
few
guttural
sounds
of
command
which
were
respectfully
listened
to
by
his
companion
he
was
evidently
a
brave
who
had
met
russians
more
than
once
before
in
quite
other
circumstances
and
nothing
about
them
could
astonish
or
even
interest
him
olenin
was
about
to
approach
the
dead
body
and
had
begun
to
look
at
it
when
the
brother
looking
up
at
him
from
under
his
brows
with
calm
contempt
said
something
sharply
and
angrily
the
scout
hastened
to
cover
the
dead
man
face
with
his
coat
olenin
was
struck
by
the
dignified
and
stem
expression
of
the
brave
face
he
began
to
speak
to
him
asking
from
what
village
he
came
but
the
chechen
scarcely
giving
him
a
glance
spat
contemptuously
and
turned
away
olenin
was
so
surprised
at
the
chechen
not
being
interested
in
him
that
he
could
only
put
it
down
to
the
man
stupidity
or
ignorance
of
russian
so
he
turned
to
the
scout
who
also
acted
as
interpreter
the
scout
was
as
ragged
as
the
other
but
instead
of
being
he
was
restless
with
extremely
white
gleaming
teeth
and
sparkling
black
eyes
the
scout
willingly
entered
into
conversation
and
asked
for
a
cigarette
were
five
brothers
began
the
scout
in
his
broken
russian
is
the
third
brother
the
russians
have
killed
only
two
are
left
he
is
a
brave
a
great
brave
he
said
pointing
to
the
chechen
they
killed
ahmet
khan
the
dead
brave
this
one
was
sitting
on
the
opposite
bank
among
the
reeds
he
saw
it
all
saw
him
laid
in
the
skiff
and
brought
to
the
bank
he
sat
there
till
the
night
and
wished
to
kill
the
old
man
but
the
others
would
not
let
him
lukashka
went
up
to
the
speaker
and
sat
down
what
village
asked
he
there
in
the
hills
replied
the
scout
pointing
to
the
misty
bluish
gorge
beyond
the
terek
you
know
it
is
about
eight
miles
beyond
that
you
know
girey
khan
in
asked
lukashka
evidently
proud
of
the
acquaintance
is
my
kunak
is
my
neighbour
answered
the
scout
a
trump
and
lukashka
evidently
much
interested
began
talking
to
the
scout
in
tartar
presently
a
cossack
captain
with
the
head
of
the
village
arrived
on
horseback
with
a
suite
of
two
cossacks
the
captain
one
of
the
new
type
of
cossack
officers
wished
the
cossacks
health
but
no
one
shouted
in
reply
good
health
to
your
honour
as
is
customary
in
the
russian
army
and
only
a
few
replied
with
a
bow
some
and
among
them
lukashka
rose
and
stood
erect
the
corporal
replied
that
all
was
well
at
the
outposts
all
this
seemed
ridiculous
it
was
as
if
these
cossacks
were
playing
at
being
soldiers
but
these
formalities
soon
gave
place
to
ordinary
ways
of
behaviour
and
the
captain
who
was
a
smart
cossack
just
like
the
others
began
speaking
fluently
in
tartar
to
the
interpreter
they
filled
in
some
document
gave
it
to
the
scout
and
received
from
him
some
money
then
they
approached
the
body
of
you
is
luke
gavrilov
asked
the
captain
lukishka
took
off
his
cap
and
came
forward
have
reported
your
exploit
to
the
commander
i
do
know
what
will
come
of
it
i
have
recommended
you
for
a
cross
you
too
young
to
be
made
a
sergeant
can
you
read
ca
what
a
fine
fellow
to
look
at
said
the
captain
again
playing
the
commander
on
your
cap
which
of
the
gavrilovs
does
he
come
of
the
broad
eh
nephew
replied
the
corporal
know
i
know
well
lend
a
hand
help
them
he
said
turning
to
the
cossacks
lukashka
face
shone
with
joy
and
seemed
handsomer
than
usual
he
moved
away
from
the
corporal
and
having
put
on
his
cap
sat
down
beside
olenin
when
the
body
had
been
carried
to
the
skiff
the
brother
chechen
descended
to
the
bank
the
cossacks
involuntarily
stepped
aside
to
let
him
pass
he
jumped
into
the
boat
and
pushed
off
from
the
bank
with
his
powerful
leg
and
now
as
olenin
noticed
for
the
first
time
threw
a
rapid
glance
at
all
the
cossacks
and
then
abruptly
asked
his
companion
a
question
the
latter
answered
something
and
pointed
to
lukashka
the
chechen
looked
at
him
and
turning
slowly
away
gazed
at
the
opposite
bank
that
look
expressed
not
hatred
but
cold
contempt
he
again
made
some
remark
is
he
saying
olenin
asked
of
the
fidgety
scout
kill
ours
ours
slay
yours
it
always
the
same
replied
the
scout
evidently
inventing
and
he
smiled
showing
his
white
teeth
as
he
jumped
into
the
skiff
the
dead
man
brother
sat
motionless
gazing
at
the
opposite
bank
he
was
so
full
of
hatred
and
contempt
that
there
was
nothing
on
this
side
of
the
river
that
moved
his
curiosity
the
scout
standing
up
at
one
end
of
the
skiff
and
dipping
his
paddle
now
on
one
side
now
on
the
other
steered
skilfully
while
talking
incessantly
the
skiff
became
smaller
and
smaller
as
it
moved
obliquely
across
the
stream
the
voices
became
scarcely
audible
and
at
last
still
within
sight
they
landed
on
the
opposite
bank
where
their
horses
stood
waiting
there
they
lifted
out
the
corpse
and
though
the
horse
shied
laid
it
across
one
of
the
saddles
mounted
and
rode
at
a
along
the
road
past
a
tartar
village
from
which
a
crowd
came
out
to
look
at
them
the
cossacks
on
the
russian
side
of
the
river
were
highly
satisfied
and
jovial
laughter
and
jokes
were
heard
on
all
sides
the
captain
and
the
head
of
the
village
entered
the
mud
hut
to
regale
themselves
lukashka
vainly
striving
to
impart
a
sedate
expression
to
his
merry
face
sat
down
with
his
elbows
on
his
knees
beside
olenin
and
whittled
away
at
a
stick
do
you
smoke
he
said
with
assumed
curiosity
it
good
he
evidently
spoke
because
he
noticed
olenin
felt
ill
at
ease
and
isolated
among
the
cossacks
just
a
habit
answered
olenin
if
one
of
us
were
to
smoke
there
would
be
a
row
look
there
now
the
mountains
are
not
far
off
continued
lukashka
you
ca
get
there
how
will
you
get
back
alone
it
getting
dark
i
take
you
if
you
like
you
ask
the
corporal
to
give
me
leave
a
fine
fellow
thought
olenin
looking
at
the
cossack
bright
face
he
remembered
maryanka
and
the
kiss
he
had
heard
by
the
gate
and
he
was
sorry
for
lukashka
and
his
want
of
culture
confusion
it
is
he
thought
man
kills
another
and
is
happy
and
satisfied
with
himself
as
if
he
had
done
something
excellent
can
it
be
that
nothing
tells
him
that
it
is
not
a
reason
for
any
rejoicing
and
that
happiness
lies
not
in
killing
but
in
sacrificing
oneself
you
had
better
not
meet
him
again
now
mate
said
one
of
the
cossacks
who
had
seen
the
skiff
off
addressing
lukashka
you
hear
him
asking
about
you
lukashka
raised
his
head
godson
said
lukashka
meaning
by
that
word
the
dead
chechen
godson
wo
rise
but
the
red
one
is
the
godson
brother
him
thank
god
that
he
got
off
whole
himself
replied
lukashka
are
you
glad
about
asked
olenin
your
brother
had
been
killed
would
you
be
glad
the
cossack
looked
at
olenin
with
laughing
eyes
he
seemed
to
have
understood
all
that
olenin
wished
to
say
to
him
but
to
be
above
such
considerations
that
happens
too
do
our
fellows
get
killed
sometimes
chapter
xxii
the
captain
and
the
head
of
the
village
rode
away
and
olenin
to
please
lukashka
as
well
as
to
avoid
going
back
alone
through
the
dark
forest
asked
the
corporal
to
give
lukashka
leave
and
the
corporal
did
so
olenin
thought
that
lukashka
wanted
to
see
maryanka
and
he
was
also
glad
of
the
companionship
of
such
a
and
sociable
cossack
lukashka
and
maryanka
he
involuntarily
united
in
his
mind
and
he
found
pleasure
in
thinking
about
them
loves
maryanka
thought
olenin
i
could
love
her
and
a
new
and
powerful
emotion
of
tenderness
overcame
him
as
they
walked
homewards
together
through
the
dark
forest
lukashka
too
felt
happy
something
akin
to
love
made
itself
felt
between
these
two
very
different
young
men
every
time
they
glanced
at
one
another
they
wanted
to
laugh
which
gate
do
you
enter
asked
olenin
the
middle
one
but
i
see
you
as
far
as
the
marsh
after
that
you
have
nothing

afraid

said
lukashka
to
set
olenin
at
rest
and
he
laughed
too
come
in
with
me
we
have
a
talk
and
a
drink
and
in
the
morning

lukashka

corporal
asked
me
to
go
back

you
singing
last
night
and
also
saw
you

and

by
god
help

said
olenin
glad
that
it
had
entered
his
head
to
give
a
horse
to
lukashka
though
without
knowing
why
he
felt
uncomfortable
and
confused
and
did
not
know
what
to
say
when
he
tried
to
speak
lukashka
was
the
first
to
break
the
silence
you
a
house
of
your
own
in
russia
he
asked

from
replying
that
he
had
not
only
one
but
several
houses

lukashka

at
him

where

lost

added

answered
olenin
it
had
grown
quite
dark
before
talking
in
this
way
they
approached
the
village
they
were
still
surrounded
by
the
deep
gloom
of
the
forest
the
wind
howled
through
the
the
jackals
suddenly
seemed
to
be
crying
close
beside
them
howling
chuckling
and
sobbing
but
ahead
of
them
in
the
village
the
sounds
of
women
voices
and
the
barking
of
dogs
could
already
be
heard
the
outlines
of
the
huts
were
clearly
to
be
seen
lights
gleamed
and
the
air
was
filled
with
the
peculiar
smell
of
kisyak
smoke
olenin
felt
keenly
that
night
especially
that
here
in
this
village
was
his
home
his
family
all
his
happiness
and
that
he
never
had
and
never
would
live
so
happily
anywhere
as
he
did
in
this
cossack
village
he
was
so
fond
of
everybody
and
especially
of
lukashka
that
night
on
reaching
home
to
great
surprise
olenin
with
his
own
hands
led
out
of
the
shed
a
horse
he
had
bought
in
groznoe
it
was
not
the
one
he
usually
rode
but
another
not
a
bad
horse
though
no
longer
young
and
gave
it
to
lukashka
should
you
give
me
a
present
said
lukashka
have
not
yet
done
anything
for
you
it
is
nothing
answered
olenin
it
and
you
will
give
me
a
present
and
we
go
on
an
expedition
against
the
enemy
together
lukashka
became
confused
what
mean
by
it
as
if
a
horse
were
of
little
value
he
said
without
looking
at
the
horse
it
take
it
if
you
do
you
will
offend
me
vanyusha
take
the
grey
horse
to
his
house
lukashka
took
hold
of
the
halter
then
thank
you
this
is
something
unexpected
undreamt
of
olenin

as
happy
as

twelve

down
and
took
the
willing

lukashka
bending
his

he
asked
me
to
lie
in
ambush
by
the
road
where
they
come
down
from
the
mountains
shall
we
go
together
i
not
betray
you
i
be
your
murid
we
go
we
go
some
day
lukashka
seemed
quite
to
have
quieted
down
and
to
have
understood
olenin
attitude
towards
him
his
calmness
and
the
ease
of
his
behaviour
surprised
olenin
and
he
did
not
even
quite
like
it
they
talked
long
and
it
was
late
when
lukashka
not
tipsy
he
never
was
tipsy
but
having
drunk
a
good
deal
left
olenin
after
shaking
hands
olenin
looked
out
of
the
window
to
see
what
he
would
do
lukashka
went
out
hanging
his
head
then
having
led
the
horse
out
of
the
gate
he
suddenly
shook
his
head
threw
the
reins
of
the
halter
over
its
head
sprang
onto
its
back
like
a
cat
gave
a
wild
shout
and
galloped
down
the
street
olenin
expected
that
lukishka
would
go
to
share
his
joy
with
maryanka
but
though
he
did
not
do
so
olenin
still
felt
his
soul
more
at
ease
than
ever
before
in
his
life
he
was
as
delighted
as
a
boy
and
could
not
refrain
from
telling
vanyusha
not
only
that
he
had
given
lukashka
the
horse
but
also
why
he
had
done
it
as
well
as
his
new
theory
of
happiness
vanyusha
did
not
approve
of
his
theory
and
announced
that
il
a
pas
and
that
therefore
it
was
all
nonsense
lukashka
rode
home
jumped
off
the
horse
and
handed
it
over
to
his
mother
telling
her
to
let
it
out
with
the
communal
cossack
herd
he
himself
had
to
return
to
the
cordon
that
same
night
his
deaf
sister
undertook
to
take
the
horse
and
explained
by
signs
that
when
she
saw
the
man
who
had
given
the
horse
she
would
bow
down
at
his
feet
the
old
woman
only
shook
her
head
at
her
son
story
and
decided
in
her
own
mind
that
he
had
stolen
it
she
therefore
told
the
deaf
girl
to
take
it
to
the
herd
before
daybreak
lukashka
went
back
alone
to
the
cordon
pondering
over
olenin
action
though
he
did
not
consider
the
horse
a
good
one
yet
it
was
worth
at
least
forty
rubles
and
lukashka
was
very
glad
to
have
the
present
but
why
it
had
been
given
him
he
could
not
at
all
understand
and
therefore
he
did
not
experience
the
least
feeling
of
gratitude
on
the
contrary
vague
suspicions
that
the
cadet
had
some
evil
intentions
filled
his
mind
what
those
intentions
were
he
could
not
decide
but
neither
could
he
admit
the
idea
that
a
stranger
would
give
him
a
horse
worth
forty
rubles
for
nothing
just
out
of
kindness
it
seemed
impossible
had
he
been
drunk
one
might
understand
it
he
might
have
wished
to
show
off
but
the
cadet
had
been
sober
and
therefore
must
have
wished
to
bribe
him
to
do
something
wrong
humbug
thought
lukashka
i
got
the
horse
and
we
see
later
on
i
not
a
fool
myself
and
we
shall
see
who
get
the
better
of
the
other
he
thought
feeling
the
necessity
of
being
on
his
guard
and
therefore
arousing
in
himself
unfriendly
feelings
towards
olenin
he
told
no
one
how
he
had
got
the
horse
to
some
he
said
he
had
bought
it
to
others
he
replied
evasively
however
the
truth
soon
got
about
in
the
village
and
lukashka
mother
and
maryanka
as
well
as
elias
vasilich
and
other
cossacks
when
they
heard
of
olenin
unnecessary
gift
were
perplexed
and
began
to
be
on
their
guard
against
the
cadet
but
despite
their
fears
his
action
aroused
in
them
a
great
respect
for
his
simplicity
and
wealth
you
heard
said
one
the
cadet
quartered
on
elias
vasilich
has
thrown
a
horse
at
lukashka
he
rich
i
heard
of
it
replied
another
profoundly
must
have
done
him
some
great
service
we
shall
see
what
will
come
of
this
cadet
eh
what
luck
that
snatcher
has
cadets
are
crafty
awfully
crafty

to
a
building
or
doing
something
chapter
xxiii
olenin
life
went
on
with
monotonous
regularity
he
had
little
intercourse
with
the
commanding
officers
or
with
his
equals
the
position
of
a
rich
cadet
in
the
caucasus
was
peculiarly
advantageous
in
this
respect
he
was
not
sent
out
to
work
or
for
training
as
a
reward
for
going
on
an
expedition
he
was
recommended
for
a
commission
and
meanwhile
he
was
left
in
peace
the
officers
regarded
him
as
an
aristocrat
and
behaved
towards
him
with
dignity
cardplaying
and
the
officers
carousals
accompanied
by
the
of
which
he
had
had
experience
when
he
was
with
the
detachment
did
not
seem
to
him
attractive
and
he
also
avoided
the
society
and
life
of
the
officers
in
the
village
the
life
of
officers
stationed
in
a
cossack
village
has
long
had
its
own
definite
form
just
as
every
cadet
or
officer
when
in
a
fort
regularly
drinks
porter
plays
cards
and
discusses
the
rewards
given
for
taking
part
in
the
expeditions
so
in
the
cossack
villages
he
regularly
drinks
chikhir
with
his
hosts
treats
the
girls
to
and
honey
dangles
after
the
cossack
women
and
falls
in
love
and
occasionally
marries
there
olenin
always
took
his
own
path
and
had
an
unconscious
objection
to
the
beaten
tracks
and
here
too
he
did
not
follow
the
ruts
of
a
caucasian
officer
life
it
came
quite
naturally
to
him
to
wake
up
at
daybreak
after
drinking
tea
and
admiring
from
his
porch
the
mountains
the
morning
and
maryanka
he
would
put
on
a
tattered
coat
sandals
of
soaked
raw
hide
buckle
on
a
dagger
take
a
gun
put
cigarettes
and
some
lunch
in
a
little
bag
call
his
dog
and
soon
after
five
would
start
for
the
forest
beyond
the
village
towards
seven
in
the
evening
he
would
return
tired
and
hungry
with
five
or
six
pheasants
hanging
from
his
belt
sometimes
with
some
other
animal
and
with
his
bag
of
food
and
cigarettes
untouched
if
the
thoughts
in
his
head
had
lain
like
the
lunch
and
cigarettes
in
the
bag
one
might
have
seen
that
during
all
those
fourteen
hours
not
a
single
thought
had
moved
in
it
he
returned
morally
fresh
strong
and
perfectly
happy
and
he
could
not
tell
what
he
had
been
thinking
about
all
the
time
were
they
ideas
memories
or
dreams
that
had
been
flitting
through
his
mind
they
were
frequently
all
three
he
would
rouse
himself
and
ask
what
he
had
been
thinking
about
and
would
see
himself
as
a
cossack
working
in
a
vineyard
with
his
cossack
wife
or
an
abrek
in
the
mountains
or
a
boar
running
away
from
himself
and
all
the
time
he
kept
peering
and
watching
for
a
pheasant
a
boar
or
a
deer
in
the
evening
daddy
eroshka
would
be
sure
to
be
sitting
with
him
vanyusha
would
bring
a
jug
of
chikhir
and
they
would
converse
quietly
drink
and
separate
to
go
quite
contentedly
to
bed
the
next
day
he
would
again
go
shooting
again
be
healthily
weary
again
they
would
sit
conversing
and
drink
their
fill
and
again
be
happy
sometimes
on
a
holiday
or
day
of
rest
olenin
spent
the
whole
day
at
home
then
his
chief
occupation
was
watching
maryanka
whose
every
movement
without
realizing
it
himself
he
followed
greedily
from
his
window
or
his
porch
he
regarded
maryanka
and
loved
her
so
he
thought
just
as
he
loved
the
beauty
of
the
mountains
and
the
sky
and
he
had
no
thought
of
entering
into
any
relations
with
her
it
seemed
to
him
that
between
him
and
her
such
relations
as
there
were
between
her
and
the
cossack
lukashka
could
not
exist
and
still
less
such
as
often
existed
between
rich
officers
and
other
cossack
girls
it
seemed
to
him
that
if
he
tried
to
do
as
his
fellow
officers
did
he
would
exchange
his
complete
enjoyment
of
contemplation
for
an
abyss
of
suffering
disillusionment
and
remorse
besides
he
had
already
achieved
a
triumph
of
in
connexion
with
her
which
had
given
him
great
pleasure
and
above
all
he
was
in
a
way
afraid
of
maryanka
and
would
not
for
anything
have
ventured
to
utter
a
word
of
love
to
her
lightly
once
during
the
summer
when
olenin
had
not
gone
out
shooting
but
was
sitting
at
home
quite
unexpectedly
a
moscow
acquaintance
a
very
young
man
whom
he
had
met
in
society
came
in
mon
cher
my
dear
fellow
how
glad
i
was
when
i
heard
that
you
were
here
he
began
in
his
moscow
french
and
he
went
on
intermingling
french
words
in
his
remarks
said
olenin
what
olenin
and
i
was
so
pleased
fancy
fate
bringing
us
together
here
well
and
how
are
you
how
why
and
prince
beletski
told
his
whole
story
how
he
had
temporarily
entered
the
regiment
how
the
had
offered
to
take
him
as
an
adjutant
and
how
he
would
take
up
the
post
after
this
campaign
although
personally
he
felt
quite
indifferent
about
it
here
in
this
hole
one
must
at
least
make
a
career
get
a
cross
or
a
rank
be
transferred
to
the
guards
that
is
quite
indispensable
not
for
myself
but
for
the
sake
of
my
relations
and
friends
the
prince
received
me
very
well
he
is
a
very
decent
fellow
said
beletski
and
went
on
unceasingly
have
been
recommended
for
the
anna
cross
for
the
expedition
now
i
shall
stay
here
a
bit
until
we
start
on
the
campaign
it
capital
here
what
women
well
and
how
are
you
getting
on
i
was
told
by
our
captain
startsev
you
know
a
stupid
creature
well
he
said
you
were
living
like
an
awful
savage
seeing
no
one
i
quite
understand
you
do
want
to
be
mixed
up
with
the
set
of
officers
we
have
here
i
am
so
glad
now
you
and
i
will
be
able
to
see
something
of
one
another
i
have
put
up
at
the
cossack
corporal
house
there
is
such
a
girl
there
ustenka
i
tell
you
she
just
charming
and
more
and
more
french
and
russian
words
came
pouring
forth
from
that
world
which
olenin
thought
he
had
left
for
ever
the
general
opinion
about
beletski
was
that
he
was
a
nice
fellow
perhaps
he
really
was
but
in
spite
of
his
pretty
face
olenin
thought
him
extremely
unpleasant
he
seemed
just
to
exhale
that
filthiness
which
olenin
had
forsworn
what
vexed
him
most
was
that
he
could
not
had
not
the
strength
abruptly
to
repulse
this
man
who
came
from
that
world
as
if
that
old
world
he
used
to
belong
to
had
an
irresistible
claim
on
him
olenin
felt
angry
with
beletski
and
with
himself
yet
against
his
wish
he
introduced
french
phrases
into
his
own
conversation
was
interested
in
the
and
in
their
moscow
acquaintances
and
because
in
this
cossack
village
he
and
beletski
both
spoke
french
he
spoke
contemptuously
of
their
fellow
officers
and
of
the
cossacks
and
was
friendly
with
beletski
promising
to
visit
him
and
inviting
him
to
drop
in
to
see
him
olenin
however
did
not
himself
go
to
see
beletski
vanyusha
for
his
part
approved
of
beletski
remarking
that
he
was
a
real
gentleman
beletski
at
once
adopted
the
customary
life
of
a
rich
officer
in
a
cossack
village
before
olenin
eyes
in
one
month
he
came
to
be
like
an
old
resident
of
the
village
he
made
the
old
men
drunk
arranged
evening
parties
and
himself
went
to
parties
arranged
by
the
girls
bragged
of
his
conquests
and
even
got
so
far
that
for
some
unknown
reason
the
women
and
girls
began
calling
him
grandad
and
the
cossacks
to
whom
a
man
who
loved
wine
and
women
was
clearly
understandable
got
used
to
him
and
even
liked
him
better
than
they
did
olenin
who
was
a
puzzle
to
them

it
was

in
the
morning
vanyusha
was
in

of

had
already
ridden
off
to
bathe
in
the
terek
he
had
recently
invented
a
new
amusement
to
swim
his
horse
in
the
river
his
landlady
was
in
her
outhouse
and
the
dense
smoke
of
the
kindling
fire
rose
from
the
chimney
the
girl
was
milking
the
buffalo

in

damned

her
impatient
voice
followed
by
the
rhythmical
sound
of
milking
from
the
street
in
front
of
the
house
horses
hoofs
were
heard
clattering
briskly
and
olenin
riding
bareback
on
a
handsome
horse
which
was
still
wet
and
shining
rode
up
to
the
gate

head
tied
round
with
a
red
kerchief

from
the

and
again
disappeared

wearing
a
red
silk

a
white
circassian
coat
girdled
with
a
strap
which
carried
a
dagger
and
a
tall
cap
he
sat
his
wet
horse
with
a
slightly
conscious
elegance
and
holding
his
gun
at
his
back
stooped
to
open
the
gate
his
hair
was
still
wet
and
his
face
shone
with
youth
and
health
he
thought
himself
handsome
agile
and
like
a
brave
but
he
was
mistaken
to
any
experienced
caucasian
he
was
still
only
a
soldier
when
he
noticed
that
the
girl
had
put
out
her
head
he
stooped
with
particular
smartness
threw
open
the
gate
and
tightening
the
reins
swished
his
whip
and
entered
the
yard
tea
ready
vanyusha
he
cried
gaily
not
looking
at
the
door
of
the
shed
he
felt
with
pleasure
how
his
fine
horse
pressing
down
its
flanks
pulling
at
the
bridle
and
with
every
muscle
quivering
and
with
each
foot
ready
to
leap
over
the
fence
pranced
on
the
hard
clay
of
the

olenin
felt
as
if
maryanka
beautiful
head
was
still
looking
out
of
the
shed
but
he
did
not
turn
to
look
at
her
as
he
jumped
down
from
his
horse
he
made
an
awkward
movement
and
caught
his
gun
against
the
porch
and
turned
a
frightened
look
towards
the
shed
where
there
was
no
one
to
be
seen
and
whence
the
sound
of
milking
could
still
be
heard
soon
after
he
had
entered
the
hut
he
came
out
again
and
sat
down
with
his
pipe
and
a
book
on
the
side
of
the
porch
which
was
not
yet
exposed
to
the
rays
of
the
sun
he
meant
not
to
go
anywhere
before
dinner
that
day
and
to
write
some
letters
but
somehow
he
felt
disinclined
to
leave
his
place
in
the
porch
and
he
was
as
reluctant
to
go
back
into
the
hut
as
if
it
had
been
a
prison
the
housewife
had
heated
her
oven
and
the
girl
having
driven
the
cattle
had
come
back
and
was
collecting
i
kisyak
and
heaping
it
up
along
the
fence
olenin
went
on
reading
but
did
not
understand
a
word
of
what
was
written
in
the
book
that
lay
open
before
him
he
kept
lifting
his
eyes
from
it
and
looking
at
the
powerful
young
woman
who
was
moving
about
whether
she
stepped
into
the
moist
morning
shadow
thrown
by
the
house
or
went
out
into
the
middle
of
the
yard
lit
up
by
the
joyous
young
light
so
that
the
whole
of
her
stately
figure
in
its
bright
coloured
garment
gleamed
in
the
sunshine
and
cast
a
black
shadow
he
always
feared
to
lose
any
one
of
her
movements
it
delighted
him
to
see
how
freely
and
gracefully
her
figure
bent
into
what
folds
her
only
garment
a
pink
smock
draped
itself
on
her
bosom
and
along
her
shapely
legs
how
she
drew
herself
up
and
her
smock
showed
the
outline
of
her
heaving
bosom
how
the
soles
of
her
narrow
feet
in
her
worn
red
slippers
rested
on
the
ground
without
altering
their
shape
how
her
strong
arms
with
the
sleeves
rolled
up
exerting
the
muscles
used
the
spade
almost
as
if
in
anger
and
how
her
deep
dark
eyes
sometimes
glanced
at
him
though
the
delicate
brows
frowned
yet
her
eyes
expressed
pleasure
and
a
knowledge
of
her
own
beauty
say
olenin
have
you
been
up
long
said
beletski
as
he
entered
the
yard
dressed
in
the
coat
of
a
caucasian
officer
beletski
replied
olenin
holding
out
his
hand
is
it
you
are
out
so
early
had
to
i
was
driven
out
we
are
having
a
ball
tonight
maryanka
of
course
you
come
to
ustenka
he
added
turning
to
the
girl
olenin
felt
surprised
that
beletski
could
address
this
woman
so
easily
but
maryanka
as
though
she
had
not
heard
him
bent
her
head
and
throwing
the
spade
across
her
shoulder
went
with
her
firm
masculine
tread
towards
the
outhouse
shy
the
wench
is
shy
beletski
called
after
her
of
you
he
added
as
smiling
gaily
he
ran
up
the
steps
of
the
porch
is
it
you
are
having
a
ball
and
have
been
driven
out
at
ustenka
at
my
landlady
that
the
ball
is
and
you
two
are
invited
a
ball
consists
of
a
pie
and
a
gathering
of
girls
should
we
do
there
beletski
smiled
knowingly
and
winked
jerking
his
head
in
the
direction
of
the
outhouse
into
which
maryanka
had
disappeared
olenin
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
blushed
really
you
are
a
strange
fellow
said
he
now
do
olenin
frowned
and
beletski
noticing
this
smiled
insinuatingly
come
what
do
you
mean
he
said
in
the
same
house
and
such
a
fine
girl
a
splendid
girl
a
perfect
beauty
beautiful
i
never
saw
such
a
woman
before
replied
olenin
then
said
beletski
quite
unable
to
understand
the
situation
may
be
strange
replied
olenin
why
should
i
not
say
what
is
true
since
i
have
lived
here
women
do
seem
to
exist
for
me
and
it
is
so
good
really
now
what
can
there
be
in
common
between
us
and
women
like
these
eroshka
that
a
different
matter
he
and
i
have
a
passion
in
common
sport
now
in
common
and
what
have
i
in
common
with
amalia
ivanovna
it
the
same
thing
you
may
say
they
not
very
clean
that
another
matter
a
la
guerre
comme
a
la
guerre
i
have
never
known
any
amalia
ivanovas
and
have
never
known
how
to
behave
with
women
of
that
sort
replied
olenin
can
not
respect
them
but
these
i
do
respect
go
on
respecting
them
who
wants
to
prevent
you
olenin
did
not
reply
he
evidently
wanted
to
complete
what
he
had
begun
to
say
it
was
very
near
his
heart
know
i
am
an
exception
he
was
visibly
confused
my
life
has
so
shaped
itself
that
i
not
only
see
no
necessity
to
renounce
my
rules
but
i
could
not
live
here
let
alone
live
as
happily
as
i
am
doing
were
i
to
live
as
you
do
therefore
i
look
for
something
quite
different
from
what
you
look
for
beletski
raised
his
eyebrows
incredulously
come
to
me
this
evening
maryanka
will
be
there
and
i
will
make
you
acquainted
do
come
please
if
you
feel
dull
you
can
go
away
will
you
come
would
come
but
to
speak
frankly
i
am
afraid
of
being
seriously
carried
away
oh
oh
shouted
beletski
come
and
i
see
that
you
are
will
you
on
your
word
would
come
but
really
i
do
understand
what
we
shall
do
what
part
we
shall
play
i
beg
of
you
you
will
come
perhaps
i
come
said
olenin
now
charming
women
such
as
one
sees
nowhere
else
and
to
live
like
a
monk
what
an
idea
why
spoil
your
life
and
not
make
use
of
what
is
at
hand
have
you
heard
that
our
company
is
ordered
to
vozdvizhensk
i
was
told
the
company
would
be
sent
there
said
olenin
i
have
had
a
letter
from
the
adjutant
there
he
writes
that
the
prince
himself
will
take
part
in
the
campaign
i
am
very
glad
i
shall
see
something
of
him
i
beginning
to
get
tired
of
this
place
hear
we
shall
start
on
a
raid
soon
have
not
heard
of
it
but
i
have
heard
that
krinovitsin
has
received
the
order
of
anna
for
a
raid
he
expected
a
lieutenancy
said
beletski
laughing
was
let
in
he
has
set
off
for
headquarters
it
was
growing
dusk
and
olenin
began
thinking
about
the
party
the
invitation
he
had
received
worried
him
he
felt
inclined
to
go
but
what
might
take
place
there
seemed
strange
absurd
and
even
rather
alarming
he
knew
that
neither
cossack
men
nor
older
women
nor
anyone
besides
the
girls
were
to
be
there
what
was
going
to
happen
how
was
he
to
behave
what
would
they
talk
about
what
connexion
was
there
between
him
and
those
wild
cossack
girls
beletski
had
told
him
of
such
curious
cynical
and
yet
rigid
relations
it
seemed
strange
to
think
that
he
would
be
there
in
the
same
hut
with
maryanka
and
perhaps
might
have
to
talk
to
her
it
seemed
to
him
impossible
when
he
remembered
her
majestic
bearing
but
beletski
spoke
of
it
as
if
it
were
all
perfectly
simple
it
possible
that
beletski
will
treat
maryanka
in
the
same
way
that
is
interesting
thought
he
better
not
go
it
all
so
horrid
so
vulgar
and
above
all
it
leads
to
nothing
but
again
he
was
worried
by
the
question
of
what
would
take
place
and
besides
he
felt
as
if
bound
by
a
promise
he
went
out
without
having
made
up
his
mind
one
way
or
the
other
but
he
walked
as
far
as
beletski
and
went
in
there
the
hut
in
which
beletski
lived
was
like
olenin
it
was
raised
nearly
five
feet
from
the
ground
on
wooden
piles
and
had
two
rooms
in
the
first
which
olenin
entered
by
the
steep
flight
of
steps
feather
beds
rugs
blankets
and
cushions
were
tastefully
and
handsomely
arranged
cossack
fashion
along
the
main
wall
on
the
side
wall
hung
brass
basins
and
weapons
while
on
the
floor
under
a
bench
lay
watermelons
and
pumpkins
in
the
second
room
there
was
a
big
brick
oven
a
table
and
sectarian
icons
it
was
here
that
beletski
was
quartered
with
his
and
his
pack
and
trunks
his
weapons
hung
on
the
wall
with
a
little
rug
behind
them
and
on
the
table
were
his
toilet
appliances
and
some
portraits
a
silk
had
been
thrown
on
the
bench
beletski
himself
clean
and
lay
on
the
bed
in
his
underclothing
reading
les
trois
mousquetaires
he
jumped
up
you
see
how
i
have
arranged
things
fine
well
it
good
that
you
have
come
they
are
working
furiously
do
you
know
what
the
pie
is
made
of
dough
with
a
stuffing
of
pork
and
grapes
but
that
not
the
point
you
just
look
at
the
commotion
out
there
and
really
on
looking
out
of
the
window
they
saw
an
unusual
bustle
going
on
in
the
hut
girls
ran
in
and
out
now
for
one
thing
and
now
for
another
it
soon
be
ready
cried
beletski
soon
why
is
grandad
hungry
and
from
the
hut
came
the
sound
of
ringing
laughter
ustenka
plump
small
rosy
and
pretty
with
her
sleeves
turned
up
ran
into
beletski
hut
to
fetch
some
plates
away
or
i
shall
smash
the
plates
she
squeaked
escaping
from
beletski
better
come
and
help
she
shouted
to
olenin
laughing
do
forget
to
get
some
refreshments
for
the
girls
meaning
spicebread
and
sweets
has
maryanka
come
course
she
brought
some
dough
you
know
said
beletski
one
were
to
dress
ustenka
up
and
clean
and
polish
her
up
a
bit
she
be
better
than
all
our
beauties
have
you
ever
seen
that
cossack
woman
who
married
a
colonel
she
was
charming
borsheva
what
dignity
where
do
they
get
it
have
not
seen
borsheva
but
i
think
nothing
could
be
better
than
the
costume
they
wear
here
i
at
fitting
into
any
kind
of
life
said
beletski
with
a
sigh
of
pleasure
go
and
see
what
they
are
up
to
he
threw
his
over
his
shoulders
and
ran
out
shouting
you
look
after
the
refreshments
olenin
sent
beletski
orderly
to
buy
and
honey
but
it
suddenly
seemed
to
him
so
disgusting
to
give
money
as
if
he
were
bribing
someone
that
he
gave
no
definite
reply
to
the
question
much
with
peppermint
and
how
much
with
honey
as
you
please
i
spend
all
the
money
asked
the
old
soldier
impressively
peppermint
is
dearer
it
sixteen
kopeks
yes
spend
it
all
answered
olenin
and
sat
down
by
the
window
surprised
that
his
heart
was
thumping
as
if
he
were
preparing
himself
for
something
serious
and
wicked
he
heard
screaming
and
shrieking
in
the
girls
hut
when
beletski
went
there
and
a
few
moments
later
saw
how
he
jumped
out
and
ran
down
the
steps
accompanied
by
shrieks
bustle
and
laughter
out
he
said
a
little
later
ustenka
entered
and
solemnly
invited
her
visitors
to
come
in
announcing
that
all
was
ready
when
they
came
into
the
room
they
saw
that
everything
was
really
ready
ustenka
was
rearranging
the
cushions
along
the
wall
on
the
table
which
was
covered
by
a
disproportionately
small
cloth
was
a
decanter
of
chikhir
and
some
dried
fish
the
room
smelt
of
dough
and
grapes
some
half
dozen
girls
in
smart
tunics
with
their
heads
not
covered
as
usual
with
kerchiefs
were
huddled
together
in
a
corner
behind
the
oven
whispering
giggling
and
spluttering
with
laughter
humbly
beg
you
to
do
honour
to
my
patron
saint
said
ustenka
inviting
her
guests
to
the
table
olenin
noticed
maryanka
among
the
group
of
girls
who
without
exception
were
all
handsome
and
he
felt
vexed
and
hurt
that
he
met
her
in
such
vulgar
and
awkward
circumstances
he
felt
stupid
and
awkward
and
made
up
his
mind
to
do
what
beletski
did
beletski
stepped
to
the
table
somewhat
solemnly
yet
with
confidence
and
ease
drank
a
glass
of
wine
to
ustenka
health
and
invited
the
others
to
do
the
same
ustenka
announced
that
girls
do
drink
might
with
a
little
honey
exclaimed
a
voice
from
among
the
group
of
girls
the
orderly
who
had
just
returned
with
the
honey
and
was
called
in
he
looked
askance
whether
with
envy
or
with
contempt
at
the
gentlemen
who
in
his
opinion
were
on
the
spree
and
carefully
and
conscientiously
handed
over
to
them
a
piece
of
honeycomb
and
the
cakes
wrapped
up
in
a
piece
of
greyish
paper
and
began
explaining
circumstantially
all
about
the
price
and
the
change
but
beletski
sent
him
away
having
mixed
honey
with
wine
in
the
glasses
and
having
lavishly
scattered
the
three
pounds
of
on
the
table
beletski
dragged
the
girls
from
their
corners
by
force
made
them
sit
down
at
the
table
and
began
distributing
the
cakes
among
them
olenin
involuntarily
noticed
how
maryanka
sunburnt
but
small
hand
closed
on
two
round
peppermint
nuts
and
one
brown
one
and
that
she
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
them
the
conversation
was
halting
and
constrained
in
spite
of
ustenka
and
beletski
free
and
easy
manner
and
their
wish
to
enliven
the
company
olenin
faltered
and
tried
to
think
of
something
to
say
feeling
that
he
was
exciting
curiosity
and
perhaps
provoking
ridicule
and
infecting
the
others
with
his
shyness
he
blushed
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
maryanka
in
particular
was
feeling
uncomfortable
likely
they
are
expecting
us
to
give
them
some
money
thought
he
are
we
to
do
it
and
how
can
we
manage
quickest
to
give
it
and
get
away

xxv
is

your

said
beletski
addressing
maryanka
is
one
to
know
him
if
he
never
comes
to
see
us
answered
maryanka
with
a
look
at
olenin
olenin
felt
frightened
he
did
not
know
of
what
he
flushed
and
hardly
knowing
what
he
was
saying
remarked
afraid
of
your
mother
she
gave
me
such
a
scolding
the
first
time
i
went
in
maryanka
burst
out
laughing
so
you
were
frightened
she
said
and
glanced
at
him
and
turned
away
it
was
the
first
time
olenin
had
seen
the
whole
of
her
beautiful
face
till
then
he
had
seen
her
with
her
kerchief
covering
her
to
the
eyes
it
was
not
for
nothing
that
she
was
reckoned
the
beauty
of
the
village
ustenka
was
a
pretty
girl
small
plump
rosy
with
merry
brown
eyes
and
red
lips
which
were
perpetually
smiling
and
chattering
maryanka
on
the
contrary
was
certainly
not
pretty
but
beautiful
her
features
might
have
been
considered
too
masculine
and
almost
harsh
had
it
not
been
for
her
tall
stately
figure
her
powerful
chest
and
shoulders
and
especially
the
severe
yet
tender
expression
of
her
long
dark
eyes
which
were
darkly
shadowed
beneath
their
black
brows
and
for
the
gentle
expression
of
her
mouth
and
smile
she
rarely
smiled
but
her
smile
was
always
striking
she
seemed
to
radiate
virginal
strength
and
health
all
the
girls
were
but
they
themselves
and
beletski
and
the
orderly
when
he
brought
in
the
all
involuntarily
gazed
at
maryanka
and
anyone
addressing
the
girls
was
sure
to
address
her
she
seemed
a
proud
and
happy
queen
among
them
beletski
trying
to
keep
up
the
spirit
of
the
party
chattered
incessantly
made
the
girls
hand
round
chikhir
fooled
about
with
them
and
kept
making
improper
remarks
in
french
about
maryanka
beauty
to
olenin
calling
her
la
votre
and
advising
him
to
behave
as
he
did
himself
olenin
felt
more
and
more
uncomfortable
he
was
devising
an
excuse
to
get
out
and
run
away
when
beletski
announced
that
ustenka
whose
saint
day
it
was
must
offer
chikhir
to
everybody
with
a
kiss
she
consented
on
condition
that
they
should
put
money
on
her
plate
as
is
the
custom
at
weddings
fiend
brought
me
to
this
disgusting
feast
thought
olenin
rising
to
go
away
are
you
off
to
fetch
some
tobacco
he
said
meaning
to
escape
but
beletski
seized
his
hand
have
some
money
he
said
to
him
in
french
ca
go
away
one
has
to
pay
here
thought
olenin
bitterly
vexed
at
his
own
awkwardness
i
really
behave
like
beletski
i
ought
not
to
have
come
but
once
i
am
here
i
must
not
spoil
their
fun
i
must
drink
like
a
cossack
and
taking
the
wooden
bowl
holding
about
eight
tumblers
he
almost
filled
it
with
chikhir
and
drank
it
almost
all
the
girls
looked
at
him
surprised
and
almost
frightened
as
he
drank
it
seemed
to
them
strange
and
not
right
ustenka
brought
them
another
glass
each
and
kissed
them
both
girls
now
we
have
some
fun
she
said
clinking
on
the
plate
the
four
rubles
the
men
had
put
there
olenin
no
longer
felt
awkward
but
became
talkative
maryanka
it
your
turn
to
offer
us
wine
and
a
kiss
said
beletski
seizing
her
hand
i
give
you
such
a
kiss
she
said
playfully
preparing
to
strike
at
him
can
kiss
grandad
without
payment
said
another
girl
a
sensible
girl
said
beletski
kissing
the
struggling
girl
you
must
offer
it
he
insisted
addressing
maryanka
a
glass
to
your
lodger
and
taking
her
by
the
hand
he
led
her
to
the
bench
and
sat
her
down
beside
olenin
a
beauty
he
said
turning
her
head
to
see
it
in
profile
maryanka
did
not
resist
but
proudly
smiling
turned
her
long
eyes
towards
olenin
beautiful
girl
repeated
beletski
see
what
a
beauty
i
am
maryanka
look
seemed
to
endorse
without
considering
what
he
was
doing
olenin
embraced
maryanka
and
was
going
to
kiss
her
but
she
suddenly
extricated
herself
upsetting
beletski
and
pushing
the
top
off
the
table
and
sprang
away
towards
the
oven
there
was
much
shouting
and
laughter
then
beletski
whispered
something
to
the
girls
and
suddenly
they
all
ran
out
into
the
passage
and
locked
the
door
behind
them
did
you
kiss
beletski
and
wo
kiss
me
asked
olenin
just
so
i
do
want
to
that
all
she
answered
pouting
and
frowning
grandad
she
added
with
a
smile
she
went
to
the
door
and
began
to
bang
at
it
have
you
locked
the
door
you
devils
let
them
be
there
and
us
here
said
olenin
drawing
closer
to
her
she
frowned
and
sternly
pushed
him
away
with
her
hand
and
again
she
appeared
so
majestically
handsome
to
olenin
that
he
came
to
his
senses
and
felt
ashamed
of
what
he
was
doing
he
went
to
the
door
and
began
pulling
at
it
himself
open
the
door
what
a
stupid
joke
maryanka
again
gave
a
bright
happy
laugh
you
afraid
of
me
she
said
you
know
you
as
cross
as
your
mother
more
of
your
time
with
eroshka
that
will
make
the
girls
love
you
and
she
smiled
looking
straight
and
close
into
his
eyes
he
did
not
know
what
to
reply
if
i
were
to
come
to
see
you
he
let
fall
would
be
a
different
matter
she
replied
tossing
her
head
at
that
moment
beletski
pushed
the
door
open
and
maryanka
sprang
away
from
olenin
and
in
doing
so
her
thigh
struck
his
leg
all
nonsense
what
i
have
been
thinking
about
love
and
and
lukashka
happiness
is
the
one
thing
he
who
is
happy
is
right
flashed
through
olenin
mind
and
with
a
strength
unexpected
to
himself
he
seized
and
kissed
the
beautiful
maryanka
on
her
temple
and
her
cheek
maryanka
was
not
angry
but
only
burst
into
a
loud
laugh
and
ran
out
to
the
other
girls
that
was
the
end
of
the
party
ustenka
mother
returned
from
her
work
gave
all
the
girls
a
scolding
and
turned
them
all
out

thought
olenin
as
he
walked
home
need
only
slacken
the
reins
a
bit
and
i
might
fall
desperately
in
love
with
this
cossack
girl
he
went
to
bed
with
these
thoughts
but
expected
it
all
to
blow
over
and
that
he
would
continue
to
live
as
before
but
the
old
life
did
not
return
his
relations
to
maryanka
were
changed
the
wall
that
had
separated
them
was
broken
down
olenin
now
greeted
her
every
time
they
met
the
master
of
the
house
having
returned
to
collect
the
rent
on
hearing
of
olenin
wealth
and
generosity
invited
him
to
his
hut
the
old
woman
received
him
kindly
and
from
the
day
of
the
party
onwards
olenin
often
went
in
of
an
evening
and
sat
with
them
till
late
at
night
he
seemed
to
be
living
in
the
village
just
as
he
used
to
but
within
him
everything
had
changed
he
spent
his
days
in
the
forest
and
towards
eight
when
it
began
to
grow
dusk
he
would
go
to
see
his
hosts
alone
or
with
daddy
eroshka
they
grew
so
used
to
him
that
they
were
surprised
when
he
stayed
away
he
paid
well
for
his
wine
and
was
a
quiet
fellow
vanyusha
would
bring
him
his
tea
and
he
would
sit
down
in
a
corner
near
the
oven
the
old
woman
did
not
mind
him
but
went
on
with
her
work
and
over
their
tea
or
their
chikhir
they
talked
about
cossack
affairs
about
the
neighbours
or
about
russia
olenin
relating
and
the
others
inquiring
sometimes
he
brought
a
book
and
read
to
himself
maryanka
crouched
like
a
wild
goat
with
her
feet
drawn
up
under
her
sometimes
on
the
top
of
the
oven
sometimes
in
a
dark
corner
she
did
not
take
part
in
the
conversations
but
olenin
saw
her
eyes
and
face
and
heard
her
moving
or
cracking
sunflower
seeds
and
he
felt
that
she
listened
with
her
whole
being
when
he
spoke
and
was
aware
of
his
presence
while
he
silently
read
to
himself
sometimes
he
thought
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
him
and
meeting
their
radiance
he
involuntarily
became
silent
and
gazed
at
her
then
she
would
instantly
hide
her
face
and
he
would
pretend
to
be
deep
in
conversation
with
the
old
woman
while
he
listened
all
the
time
to
her
breathing
and
to
her
every
movement
and
waited
for
her
to
look
at
him
again
in
the
presence
of
others
she
was
generally
bright
and
friendly
with
him
but
when
they
were
alone
together
she
was
shy
and
rough
sometimes
he
came
in
before
maryanka
had
returned
home
suddenly
he
would
hear
her
firm
footsteps
and
catch
a
glimmer
of
her
blue
cotton
smock
at
the
open
door
then
she
would
step
into
the
middle
of
the
hut
catch
sight
of
him
and
her
eyes
would
give
a
scarcely
perceptible
kindly
smile
and
he
would
feel
happy
and
frightened
he
neither
sought
for
nor
wished
for
anything
from
her
but
every
day
her
presence
became
more
and
more
necessary
to
him
olenin
had
entered
into
the
life
of
the
cossack
village
so
fully
that
his
past
seemed
quite
foreign
to
him
as
to
the
future
especially
a
future
outside
the
world
in
which
he
was
now
living
it
did
not
interest
him
at
all
when
he
received
letters
from
home
from
relatives
and
friends
he
was
offended
by
the
evident
distress
with
which
they
regarded
him
as
a
lost
man
while
he
in
his
village
considered
those
as
lost
who
did
not
live
as
he
was
living
he
felt
sure
he
would
never
repent
of
having
broken
away
from
his
former
surroundings
and
of
having
settled
down
in
this
village
to
such
a
solitary
and
original
life
when
out
on
expeditions
and
when
quartered
at
one
of
the
forts
he
felt
happy
too
but
it
was
here
from
under
daddy
eroshka
wing
from
the
forest
and
from
his
hut
at
the
end
of
the
village
and
especially
when
he
thought
of
maryanka
and
lukashka
that
he
seemed
to
see
the
falseness
of
his
former
life
that
falseness
used
to
rouse
his
indignation
even
before
but
now
it
seemed
inexpressibly
vile
and
ridiculous
here
he
felt
freer
and
freer
every
day
and
more
and
more
of
a
man
the
caucasus
now
appeared
entirely
different
to
what
his
imagination
had
painted
it
he
had
found
nothing
at
all
like
his
dreams
nor
like
the
descriptions
of
the
caucasus
he
had
heard
and
read
are
none
of
all
those
chestnut
steeds
precipices
amalet
beks
heroes
or
villains
thought
he
people
live
as
nature
lives
they
die
are
born
unite
and
more
are
born
they
fight
eat
and
drink
rejoice
and
die
without
any
restrictions
but
those
that
nature
imposes
on
sun
and
grass
on
animal
and
tree
they
have
no
other
laws
therefore
these
people
compared
to
himself
appeared
to
him
beautiful
strong
and
free
and
the
sight
of
them
made
him
feel
ashamed
and
sorry
for
himself
often
it
seriously
occurred
to
him
to
throw
up
everything
to
get
registered
as
a
cossack
to
buy
a
hut
and
cattle
and
marry
a
cossack
woman
only
not
maryanka
whom
he
conceded
to
lukashka
and
to
live
with
daddy
eroshka
and
go
shooting
and
fishing
with
him
and
go
with
the
cossacks
on
their
expeditions
ever
do
i
do
it
what
am
i
waiting
for
he
asked
himself
and
he
egged
himself
on
and
shamed
himself
i
afraid
of
doing
what
i
hold
to
be
reasonable
and
right
is
the
wish
to
be
a
simple
cossack
to
live
close
to
nature
not
to
injure
anyone
but
even
to
do
good
to
others
more
stupid
than
my
former
dreams
such
as
those
of
becoming
a
minister
of
state
or
a
colonel
but
a
voice
seemed
to
say
that
he
should
wait
and
not
take
any
decision
he
was
held
back
by
a
dim
consciousness
that
he
could
not
live
altogether
like
eroshka
and
lukashka
because
he
had
a
different
idea
of
happiness
he
was
held
back
by
the
thought
that
happiness
lies
in
what
he
had
done
for
lukashka
continued
to
give
him
joy
he
kept
looking
for
occasions
to
sacrifice
himself
for
others
but
did
not
meet
with
them
sometimes
he
forgot
this
newly
discovered
recipe
for
happiness
and
considered
himself
capable
of
identifying
his
life
with
daddy
eroshka
but
then
he
quickly
bethought
himself
and
promptly
clutched
at
the
idea
of
conscious
and
from
that
basis
looked
calmly
and
proudly
at
all
men
and
at
their
happiness
chapter
xxvii
just
before
the
vintage
lukashka
came
on
horseback
to
see
olenin
he
looked
more
dashing
than
ever
are
you
getting
married
asked
olenin
greeting
him
merrily
lukashka
gave
no
direct
reply
i
exchanged
your
horse
across
the
river
this
is
a
horse
a
kabarda
horse
from
the
lov
stud
i
know
horses
they
examined
the
new
horse
and
made
him
caracole
about
the
yard
the
horse
really
was
an
exceptionally
fine
one
a
broad
and
long
gelding
with
glossy
coat
thick
silky
tail
and
the
soft
fine
mane
and
crest
of
a
thoroughbred
he
was
so
well
fed
that
might
go
to
sleep
on
his
back
as
lukashka
expressed
it
his
hoofs
eyes
teeth
were
exquisitely
shaped
and
sharply
outlined
as
one
only
finds
them
in
very
horses
olenin
could
not
help
admiring
the
horse
he
had
not
yet
met
with
such
a
beauty
in
the
caucasus
how
it
goes
said
lukashka
patting
its
neck
a
step
and
so
clever
he
simply
runs
after
his
master
you
have
to
add
much
to
make
the
exchange
asked
olenin
did
not
count
it
answered
lukashka
with
a
smile
got
him
from
a
kunak
wonderfully
beautiful
horse
what
would
you
take
for
it
asked
olenin
have
been
offered
a
hundred
and
fifty
rubles
for
it
but
i
give
it
you
for
nothing
said
lukashka
merrily
say
the
word
and
it
yours
i
unsaddle
it
and
you
may
take
it
only
give
me
some
sort
of
a
horse
for
my
duties
on
no
account
then
here
is
a
dagger
i
brought
you
said
lukashka
unfastening
his
girdle
and
taking
out
one
of
the
two
daggers
which
hung
from
it
got
it
from
across
the
river
thank
you
mother
has
promised
to
bring
you
some
grapes
herself
quite
unnecessary
we
balance
up
some
day
you
see
i
offer
you
any
money
for
the
dagger
could
you
we
are
kunaks
it
just
the
same
as
when
girey
khan
across
the
river
took
me
into
his
home
and
said
choose
what
you
like
so
i
took
this
sword
it
our
custom
they
went
into
the
hut
and
had
a
drink
you
staying
here
awhile
asked
olenin
i
have
come
to
say
they
are
sending
me
from
the
cordon
to
a
company
beyond
the
terek

am
going
with
my
comrade
nazarka
when

wedding

coming
back
for
the
betrothal
and
then
i
shall
return
to
the
company
again
lukashka
replied
reluctantly
and
see
nothing
of
your
betrothed
so
what
is
the
good
of
looking
at
her
when
you
go
on
campaign
ask
in
our
company
for
lukashka
the
broad
but
what
a
lot
of
boars
there
are
in
our
parts
i
killed
two
i
take
you
christ
save
you
lukashka
mounted
his
horse
and
without
calling
on
maryanka
rode
caracoling
down
the
street
where
nazarka
was
already
awaiting
him
say
sha
we
call
round
asked
nazarka
winking
in
the
direction
of
yamka
house
a
good
one
said
lukashka
take
my
horse
to
her
and
if
i
do
come
soon
give
him
some
hay
i
shall
reach
the
company
by
the
morning
anyway
the
cadet
given
you
anything
more
am
thankful
to
have
paid
him
back
with
a
dagger
he
was
going
to
ask
for
the
horse
said
lukashka
dismounting
and
handing
over
the
horse
to
nazarka
he
darted
into
the
yard
past
olenin
very
window
and
came
up
to
the
window
of
the
cornet
hut
it
was
already
quite
dark
maryanka
wearing
only
her
smock
was
combing
her
hair
preparing
for
bed
i
whispered
the
cossack
maryanka
look
was
severely
indifferent
but
her
face
suddenly
brightened
up
when
she
heard
her
name
she
opened
the
window
and
leant
out
frightened
and
joyous
what
do
you
want
she
said
uttered
lukashka
me
in
for
a
minute
i
am
so
sick
of
waiting
it
awful
he
took
hold
of
her
head
through
the
window
and
kissed
her
do
open
do
you
talk
nonsense
i
told
you
i
wo
have
you
come
for
long
he
did
not
answer
but
went
on
kissing
her
and
she
did
not
ask
again
through
the
window
one
ca
even
hug
you
properly
said
lukashka
dear
came
the
voice
of
her
mother
is
that
with
you
lukashka
took
off
his
cap
which
might
have
been
seen
and
crouched
down
by
the
window
be
quick
whispered
maryanka
called
round
she
answered
was
asking
for
daddy
then
send
him
here
gone
said
he
was
in
a
hurry
in
fact
lukashka
stooping
as
with
big
strides
he
passed
under
the
windows
ran
out
through
the
yard
and
towards
yamka
house
unseen
by
anyone
but
olenin
after
drinking
two
bowls
of
chikhir
he
and
nazarka
rode
away
to
the
outpost
the
night
was
warm
dark
and
calm
they
rode
in
silence
only
the
footfall
of
their
horses
was
heard

the
bethrothal

taking
place
in
the
cornet
hut
lukashka
had
returned
to
the
village
but
had
not
been
to
see
olenin
and
olenin
had
not
gone
to
the
betrothal
though
he
had
been
invited
he
was
sad
as
he
had
never
been
since
he
settled
in
this
cossack
village
he
had
seen
lukashka
earlier
in
the
evening
and
was
worried
by
the
question
why
lukashka
was
so
cold
towards
him
olenin
shut
himself
up
in
his
hut
and
began
writing
in
his
diary
as
follows
things
have
i
pondered
over
lately
and
much
have
i
changed
wrote
he
i
have
come
back
to
the
copybook
maxim
the
one
way
to
be
happy
is
to
love
to
love
to
love
everybody
and
everything
to
spread
a
web
of
love
on
all
sides
and
to
take
all
who
come
into
it
in
this
way
i
caught
vanyusha
daddy
eroshka
lukashka
and
maryanka
as
olenin
was
finishing
this
sentence
daddy
eroshka
entered
the
room
eroshka
was
in
the
happiest
frame
of
mind
a
few
evenings
before
this
olenin
had
gone
to
see
him
and
had
found
him
with
a
proud
and
happy
face
deftly
skinning
the
carcass
of
a
boar
with
a
small
knife
in
the
yard
the
dogs
lyam
his
pet
among
them
were
lying
close
by
watching
what
he
was
doing
and
gently
wagging
their
tails
the
little
boys
were
respectfully
looking
at
him
through
the
fence
and
not
even
teasing
him
as
was
their
wont
his
women
neighbours
who
were
as
a
rule
not
too
gracious
towards
him
greeted
him
and
brought
him
one
a
jug
of
chikhir
another
some
clotted
cream
and
a
third
a
little
flour
the
next
day
eroshka
sat
in
his
all
covered
with
blood
and
distributed
pounds
of
taking
in
payment
money
from
some
and
wine
from
others
his
face
clearly
expressed
has
sent
me
luck
i
have
killed
a
boar
so
now
i
am
wanted
consequently
he
naturally
began
to
drink
and
had
gone
on
for
four
days
never
leaving
the
village
besides
which
he
had
had
something
to
drink
at
the
betrothal
he
came
to
olenin
quite
drunk
his
face
red
his
beard
tangled
but
wearing
a
new
beshmet
trimmed
with
gold
braid
and
he
brought
with
him
a
balalayka
which
he
had
obtained
beyond
the
river
he
had
long
promised
olenin
this
treat
and
felt
in
the
mood
for
it
so
that
he
was
sorry
to
find
olenin
writing
on
write
on
my
lad
he
whispered
as
if
he
thought
that
a
spirit
sat
between
him
and
the
paper
and
must
not
be
frightened
away
and
he
softly
and
silently
sat
down
on
the
floor
when
daddy
eroshka
was
drunk
his
favourite
position
was
on
the
floor
olenin
looked
round
ordered
some
wine
to
be
brought
and
continued
to
write
eroshka
found
it
dull
to
drink
by
himself
and
he
wished
to
talk
been
to
the
betrothal
at
the
cornet
but
there
shwine
do
want
them
have
come
to
you
where
did
you
get
your
balalayka
asked
olenin
still
writing
been
beyond
the
river
and
got
it
there
brother
mine
he
answered
also
very
quietly

master

it
tartar
or
cossack
squire
or
soldiers
songs
any
kind
you
please
olenin
looked
at
him
again
smiled
and
went
on
writing
that
smile
emboldened
the
old
man
leave
off
my
lad
leave
off
he
said
with
sudden
firmness
perhaps
i
will
people
have
injured
you
but
leave
them
alone
spit
at
them
come
what
the
use
of
writing
and
writing
what
the
good
and
he
tried
to
mimic
olenin
by
tapping
the
floor
with
his
thick
fingers
and
then
twisted
his
big
face
to
express
contempt
the
good
of
writing
quibbles
better
have
a
spree
and
show
you
a
man
no
other
conception
of
writing
found
place
in
his
head
except
that
of
legal
chicanery
olenin
burst
out
laughing
and
so
did
eroshka
then
jumping
up
from
the
floor
the
latter
began
to
show
off
his
skill
on
the
balalayka
and
to
sing
tartar
songs
write
my
good
fellow

what
i
sing
to
you
when
you

more
songs

merry
now
first
he
sang
a
song
of
his
own
composing
accompanied
by
a
dance
dee
dee
dee
dee
dee
dim
say
where
did
they
last
see
him
in
a
booth
at
the
fair
he
was
selling
pins
there
then
he
sang
a
song
he
had
learnt
from
his
former
i
fell
in
love
on
monday
tuesday
nothing

but
sigh
wednesday
i
popped
the
question

waited
her

friday
late

at

then
all
hope
for
me
was
past
saturday
my
life

i
determined
like
a
man
but
for
my
salvation
sake
sunday

then
he
sang
again
dee

dee
dim

and
after

winking
twitching
his
shoulders
and
footing
it
to
the
tune
he
sang
will
kiss

and
embrace
ribbons
red
twine
round

and
call

little
grace
oh

little
grace
now
do
tell
me
do
you
love
me
true
and
he
became
so
excited
that
with
a
sudden
dashing
movement
he
started
dancing
around
the
room
accompanying
himself
the
while
songs
like
dee
dee
songs
he
sang
for
benefit
but
after
drinking
three
more
tumblers
of
chikhir
he
remembered
old
times
and
began
singing
real
cossack
and
tartar
songs
in
the
midst
of
one
of
his
favourite
songs
his
voice
suddenly
trembled
and
he
ceased
singing
and
only
continued
strumming
on
the
balalayka
my
dear
friend
he
said
the
peculiar
sound
of
his
voice
made
olenin
look
round
the
old
man
was
weeping
tears
stood
in
his
eyes
and
one
tear
was
running
down
his
cheek
are
gone
my
young
days
and
will
never
come
back
he
said
blubbering
and
halting
why
do
you
drink
he
suddenly
shouted
with
a
deafening
roar
without
wiping
away
his
tears
there
was
one
tartar
song
that
specially
moved
him
it
had
few
words
but
its
charm
lay
in
the
sad
refrain
day
dalalay
eroshka
translated
the
words
of
the
song
youth
drove
his
sheep
from
the
aoul
to
the
mountains
the
russians
came
and
burnt
the
aoul
they
killed
all
the
men
and
took
all
the
women
into
bondage
the
youth
returned
from
the
mountains
where
the
aoul
had
stood
was
an
empty
space
his
mother
not
there
nor
his
brothers
nor
his
house
one
tree
alone
was
left
standing
the
youth
sat
beneath
the
tree
and
wept
alone
like
thee
alone
am
i
left
and
eroshka
began
singing
day
dalalay
and
the
old
man
repeated
several
times
this
wailing
refrain
when
he
had
finished
the
refrain
eroshka
suddenly
seized
a
gun
that
hung
on
the
wall
rushed
hurriedly
out
into
the
yard
and
fired
off
both
barrels
into
the
air
then
again
he
began
more
dolefully
his
day
dalalay
ah
ah
and
ceased
olenin
followed
him
into
the
porch
and
looked
up
into
the
starry
sky
in
the
direction
where
the
shots
had
flashed
in
the
cornet
house
there
were
lights
and
the
sound
of
voices
in
the
yard
girls
were
crowding
round
the
porch
and
the
windows
and
running
backwards
and
forwards
between
the
hut
and
the
outhouse
some
cossacks
rushed
out
of
the
hut
and
could
not
refrain
from
shouting
the
refrain
of
daddy
eroshka
song
and
his
shots
are
you
not
at
the
betrothal
asked
olenin
mind
them
never
mind
them
muttered
the
old
man
who
had
evidently
been
offended
by
something
there
like
them
i
do
oh
those
people
come
back
into
the
hut

by
ourselves
olenin

in
lukashka

happy
wo
he
come
to
see

he
asked
lukashka
they
lied
to
him
and
said
i
am

his
girl
for
you

the
old
man
what
the
girl

said
daddy
eroshka
suddenly
and
again
he
began
to
cry
listening
to
the
old
man
talk
olenin
had
drunk
more
than
usual
now
my
lukashka
is
happy
thought
he
yet
he
felt
sad
the
old
man
had
drunk
so
much
that
evening
that
he
fell
down
on
the
floor
and
vanyusha
had
to
call
soldiers
in
to
help
and
spat
as
they
dragged
the
old
man
out
he
was
so
angry
with
the
old
man
for
his
bad
behaviour
that
he
did
not
even
say
a
single
french
word
chapter
xxix
it
was
august
for
days
the
sky
had
been
cloudless
the
sun
scorched
unbearably
and
from
early
morning
the
warm
wind
raised
a
whirl
of
hot
sand
from
the
and
from
the
road
and
bore
it
in
the
air
through
the
reeds
the
trees
and
the
village
the
grass
and
the
leaves
on
the
trees
were
covered
with
dust
the
roads
and
salt
marshes
were
baked
so
hard
that
they
rang
when
trodden
on
the
water
had
long
since
subsided
in
the
terek
and
rapidly
vanished
and
dried
up
in
the
ditches
the
slimy
banks
of
the
pond
near
the
village
were
trodden
bare
by
the
cattle
and
all
day
long
you
could
hear
the
splashing
of
water
and
the
shouting
of
girls
and
boys
bathing
the
and
the
reeds
were
already
drying
up
in
the
steppes
and
the
cattle
lowing
ran
into
the
fields
in

into

in

low
lands

villages

hidden
in
grey
mist
the
air
was
rarefied
and
smoky
it
was
said
that
abreks
had
crossed
the
now
shallow
river
and
were
prowling
on
this
side
of
it
every
night
the
sun
set
in
a
glowing
red
blaze
it
was
the
busiest
time
of
the
year
the
villagers
all
swarmed
in
the
and
the
vineyards
the
vineyards
thickly
overgrown
with
twining
verdure
lay
in
cool
deep
shade
everywhere
between
the
broad
translucent
leaves
ripe
heavy
black
clusters
peeped
out
along
the
dusty
road
from
the
vineyards
the
creaking
carts
moved
slowly
heaped
up
with
black
grapes

crushed
by

in
the
dirt

in
smocks
stained
with
with
grapes
in
their
hands
and
mouths
ran
after
their
mothers
on
the
road
you
continually
came
across
tattered
labourers
with
baskets
of
grapes
on
their
powerful
shoulders
cossack
maidens
veiled
with
kerchiefs
to
their
eyes
drove
bullocks
harnessed
to
carts
laden
high
with
grapes
soldiers
who
happened
to
meet
these
carts
asked
for
grapes
and
the
maidens
clambering
up
without
stopping
their
carts
would
take
an
armful
of
grapes
and
drop
them
into
the
skirts
of
the
soldiers
coats
in
some
homesteads
they
had

labourers
with
their
trousers
rolled
up
and
their
legs
stained
with
the
juice
grunting
pigs
gorged
themselves
with
the
empty
skins
and
rolled
about
in
them
the
flat
roofs
of
the
outhouses
were
all
spread
over
with
the
dark
amber
clusters
drying
in
the
sun
daws
and
magpies
crowded
round
the

picking
the

fluttering
from

place
to
another
the
fruits
of
the
year
labour
were
being
merrily
gathered
in
and
this
year
the
fruit
was
unusually
fine
and
plentiful
in
the
shady
green
vineyards
amid
a
sea
of
vines
laughter
songs
merriment
and
the
voices
of
women
were
to
be
heard
on
all
sides
and
glimpses
of
their
garments
could
be
seen
just
at
noon
maryanka
was
sitting
in
their
vineyard
in
the
shade
of
a
getting
out
the
family
dinner
from
under
an
unharnessed
cart
opposite
her
on
a
sat
the
cornet
who
had
returned
from
the
school
washing
his
hands
by
pouring
water
on
them
from
a
little
jug
her
little
brother
who
had
just
come
straight
out
of
the
pond
stood
wiping
his
face
with
his
wide
sleeves
and
gazed
anxiously
at
his
sister
and
his
mother
and
breathed
deeply
awaiting
his
dinner
the
old
mother
with
her
sleeves
rolled
up
over
her
strong
sunburnt
arms
was
arranging
grapes
dried
fish
and
clotted
cream
on
a
little
low
circular
tartar
table
the
cornet
wiped
his
hands

off

cap

himself
and
moved
nearer
to
the
table
the
boy
seized
the
jug
and
eagerly
began
to
drink
the
mother
and
daughter
crossed
their
legs
under
them
and
sat
down
by
the
table
even
in
the
shade
it
was
intolerably
hot
the
air
above
the
vineyard
smelt
unpleasant
the
strong
warm
wind
passing
amid
the
branches
brought
no
coolness
but
only
monotonously
bent
the
tops
of
the
pear
peach
and
mulberry
trees
with
which
the
vineyard
was
sprinkled
the
cornet
having
crossed
himself
once
more
took
a
little
jug
of
i

stood
behind
him
covered
with
a

having
had
a
drink
from
the
mouth
of
the
jug
passed
it
to
the
old
woman
he
had
nothing
on
over
his
shirt
which
was
unfastened
at
the
neck
and
showed
his
shaggy
muscular
chest
his
cunning
face
looked
cheerful
neither
in
his
attitude
nor
in
his
words
was
his
usual
wiliness
to
be
seen
he
was
cheerful
and
natural
we
finish
the
bit
beyond

asked

his

the
cornet
with
a
slight
frown

girl
hung
her
head

he
exchanged

i

the
cornet
he
said
his
master

again
received
a
thousand
rubles
in
riches
in
short
said
the
old
woman
the
whole
family
felt
cheerful
and
contented
the
work
was
progressing
successfully
the
grapes
were
more
abundant
and
finer
than
they
had
expected
after
dinner
maryanka
threw
some
grass
to
the
oxen
folded
her
i
beshmet
for
a
pillow
and
lay
down
under
the
wagon
on
the
juicy
grass
she
had
on
only
a
red
kerchief
over
her
head
and
a
faded
blue
print
smock
yet
she
felt
unbearably
hot
her
face
was
burning
and
she
did
not
know
where
to
put
her
feet
her
eyes
were
moist
with
sleepiness
and
weariness
her
lips
parted
involuntarily
and
her
chest
heaved
heavily
and
deeply
the
busy
time
of
year
had
begun
a
fortnight
ago
and
the
continuous
heavy
labour
had
filled
the
girl
life
at
dawn
she
jumped
up
washed
her
face
with
cold
water
wrapped
herself
in
a
shawl
and
ran
out
barefoot
to
see
to
the
cattle
then
she
hurriedly
put
on
her
shoes
and
her
beshmet
and
taking
a
small
bundle
of
bread
she
harnessed
the
bullocks
and
drove
away
to
the
vineyards
for
the
whole
day
there
she
cut
the
grapes
and
carried
the
baskets
with
only
an
hour
interval
for
rest
and
in
the
evening
she
returned
to
the
village
bright
and
not
tired
dragging
the
bullocks
by
a
rope
or
driving
them
with
a
long
stick
after
attending
to
the
cattle
she
took
some
sunflower
seeds
in
the
wide
sleeve
of
her
smock
and
went
to
the
corner
of
the
street
to
crack
them
and
have
some
fun
with
the
other
girls
but
as
soon
as
it
was
dusk
she
returned
home
and
after
having
supper
with
her
parents
and
her
brother
in
the
dark
outhouse
she
went
into
the
hut
healthy
and
free
from
care
and
climbed
onto
the
oven
where
half
drowsing
she
listened
to
their
lodger
conversation
as
soon
as
he
went
away
she
would
throw
herself
down
on
her
bed
and
sleep
soundly
and
quietly
till
morning
and
so
it
went
on
day
after
day
she
had
not
seen
lukashka
since
the
day
of
their
betrothal
but
calmly
awaited
the
wedding
she
had
got
used
to
their
lodger
and
felt
his
intent
looks
with
pleasure

from
the
heat

the

in
the

exclaimed

jumped
up

some
green
branches

maryanka
struggling
it
and
they
both
broke
into
such
peals
of
laughter
that
maryanka

shouted
to

out
from

worth
fifty

in
particular
saw
with
pleasure
his
daughter
growing
intimacy
with
olenin
i
do
know
how
to
do
the
work
replied
olenin
trying
not
to
look
through
the
green
branches
under
the
wagon
where
he
had
now
noticed
maryanka
blue
smock
and
red
kerchief
i
give
you
some
peaches
said
the
old
woman
only
according
to
the
ancient
cossack
hospitality
it
her
old
woman
silliness
said
the
cornet
explaining
and
apparently
correcting
his
wife
words
russia
i
expect
it
not
so
much
peaches
as
pineapple
jam
and
preserves
you
have
been
accustomed
to
eat
at
your
pleasure
you
say
hares
are
to
be
found
in
the
disused
vineyard
asked
olenin
will
go
there
and
throwing
a
hasty
glance
through
the
green
branches
he
raised
his
cap
and
disappeared
between
the
regular
rows
of
green
vines
the
sun
had
already
sunk
behind
the
fence
of
the
vineyards
and
its
broken
rays
glittered
through
the
translucent
leaves
when
olenin
returned
to
his
host
vineyard
the
wind
was
falling
and
a
cool
freshness
was
beginning
to
spread
around
by
some
instinct
olenin
recognized
from
afar
maryanka
blue
smock
among
the
rows
of
vine
and
picking
grapes
on
his
way
he
approached
her
his
highly
excited
dog
also
now
and
then
seized
a
cluster
of
grapes
in
his
slobbering
mouth
maryanka
her
face
flushed
her
sleeves
rolled
up
and
her
kerchief
down
below
her
chin
was
rapidly
cutting
the
heavy
clusters
and
laying
them
in
a
basket
without
letting
go
of
the
vine
she
had
hold
of
she
stopped
to
smile
pleasantly
at
him
and
resumed
her
work
olenin
drew
near
and
threw
his
gun
behind
his
back
to
have
his
hands
free
are
your
people
may
god
aid
you
are
you
alone
he
meant
to
say
but
did
not
say
and
only
raised
his
cap
in
silence
he
was
ill
at
ease
alone
with
maryanka
but
as
if
purposely
to
torment
himself
he
went
up
to
her
be
shooting
the
women
with
your
gun
like
that
said
maryanka
i
sha
shoot
them
they
were
both
silent
then
after
a
pause
she
said
should
help
me
he
took
out
his
knife
and
began
silently
to
cut
off
the
clusters
he
reached
from
under
the
leaves
low
down
a
thick
bunch
weighing
about
three
pounds
the
grapes
of
which
grew
so
close
that
they
flattened
each
other
for
want
of
space
he
showed
it
to
maryanka
they
all
be
cut
is
this
one
too
green
it
here
their
hands
touched
olenin
took
her
hand
and
she
looked
at
him
smiling
you
going
to
be
married
soon
he
asked
she
did
not
answer
but
turned
away
with
a
stern
look
you
love
lukashka
that
to
you
envy
him
likely
really
you
are
so
beautiful
and
he
suddenly
felt
terribly
ashamed
of
having
said
it
so
commonplace
did
the
words
seem
to
him
he
flushed
lost
control
of
himself
and
seized
both
her
hands
i
am
i
not
for
you
why
do
you
make
fun
of
me
replied
maryanka
but
her
look
showed
how
certainly
she
knew
he
was
not
making
fun
fun
if
you
only
knew
how
i
the
words
sounded
still
more
commonplace
they
accorded
still
less
with
what
he
felt
but
yet
he
continued
do
know
what
i
would
not
do
for
you
me
alone
you
pitch
but
her
face
her
shining
eyes
her
swelling
bosom
her
shapely
legs
said
something
quite
different
it
seemed
to
him
that
she
understood
how
petty
were
all
things
he
had
said
but
that
she
was
superior
to
such
considerations
it
seemed
to
him
she
had
long
known
all
he
wished
and
was
not
able
to
tell
her
but
wanted
to
hear
how
he
would
say
it
how
can
she
help
knowing
he
thought
i
only
want
to
tell
her
all
that
she
herself
is
but
she
does
not
wish
to
does
not
wish
to
reply
suddenly
came
ustenka
high
voice
from
behind
the
vine
at
no
great
distance
followed
by
her
shrill
laugh
and
help
me
dmitri
andreich
i
am
all
alone
she
cried
thrusting
her
round
naive
little
face
through
the
vines
olenin
did
not
answer
nor
move
from
his
place
maryanka
went
on
cutting
and
continually
looked
up
at
olenin
he
was
about
to
say
something
but
stopped
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
having
jerked
up
his
gun
walked
out
of
the
vineyard
with
rapid
strides
chapter
xxxii
he
stopped
once
or
twice
listening
to
the
ringing
laughter
of
maryanka
and
ustenka
who
having
come
together
were
shouting
something
olenin
spent
the
whole
evening
hunting
in
the
forest
and
returned
home
at
dusk
without
having
killed
anything
when
crossing
the
road
he
noticed
her
open
the
door
of
the
outhouse
and
her
blue
smock
showed
through
it
he
called
to
vanyusha
very
loud
so
as
to
let
her
know
that
he
was
back
and
then
sat
down
in
the
porch
in
his
usual
place
his
hosts
now
returned
from
the
vineyard
they
came
out
of
the
outhouse
and
into
their
hut
but
did
not
ask
of
the
latch
and
knocked
the
floor
hardly
creaked
under
the
bare
cautious
footsteps
which
approached
the
door
the
latch
clicked
the
door
creaked
and
he
noticed
a
faint
smell
of
marjoram
and
pumpkin
and
maryanka
whole
figure
appeared
in
the
doorway
he
saw
her
only
for
an
instant
in
the
moonlight
she
slammed
the
door
and
muttering
something
ran
lightly
back
again
olenin
began
rapping
softly
but
nothing
responded
he
ran
to
the
window
and
listened
suddenly
he
was
startled
by
a
shrill
squeaky
man
voice
exclaimed
a
rather
small
young
cossack
in
a
white
cap
coming
across
the
yard
close
to
olenin
saw
fine
olenin
recognized
nazarka
and
was
silent
not
knowing
what
to
do
or
say
i
go
and
tell
them
at
the
office
and
i
tell
her
father
that
a
fine
cornet
daughter
one
not
enough
for
her
do
you
want
of
me
what
are
you
after
uttered
olenin
only
i
tell
them
at
the
office
nazarka
spoke
very
loud
and
evidently
did
so
intentionally
adding
see
what
a
clever
cadet
olenin
trembled
and
grew
pale
here
here
he
seized
the
cossack
firmly
by
the
arm
and
drew
him
towards
his
hut
happened
she
did
not
let
me
in
and
i
too
mean
no
harm
she
is
an
honest
girl
discuss
but
all
the
same
i
give
you
something
now
wait
a
bit
nazarka
said
nothing
olenin
ran
into
his
hut
and
brought
out
ten
rubles
which
he
gave
to
the
cossack
happened
but
still
i
was
to
blame
so
i
give
this
only
for
god
sake
do
let
anyone
know
for
nothing
happened
wish
you
joy
said
nazarka
laughing
and
went
away
nazarka
had
come
to
the
village
that
night
at
lukashka
bidding
to
find
a
place
to
hide
a
stolen
horse
and
now
passing
by
on
his
way
home
had
heard
the
sound
of
footsteps
when
he
returned
next
morning
to
his
company
he
bragged
to
his
chum
and
told
him
how
cleverly
he
had
got
ten
rubles
next
morning
olenin
met
his
hosts
and
they
knew
nothing
about
the
events
of
the
night
he
did
not
speak
to
maryanka
and
she
only
laughed
a
little
when
she
looked
at
him
next
night
he
also
passed
without
sleep
vainly
wandering
about
the
yard
the
day
after
he
purposely
spent
shooting
and
in
the
evening
he
went
to
see
beletski
to
escape
from
his
own
thoughts
he
was
afraid
of
himself
and
promised
himself
not
to
go
to
his
hosts
hut
any
more
that
night
he
was
roused
by
the
his
company
was
ordered
to
start
at
once
on
a
raid
olenin
was
glad
this
had
happened
and
thought
he
would
not
again
return
to
the
village
the
raid
lasted
four
days
the
commander
who
was
a
relative
of
olenin
wished
to
see
him
and
offered
to
let
him
remain
with
the
staff
but
this
olenin
declined
he
found
that
he
could
not
live
away
from
the
village
and
asked
to
be
allowed
to
return
to
it
for
having
taken
part
in
the
raid
he
received
a
soldier
cross
which
he
had
formerly
greatly
desired
now
he
was
quite
indifferent
about
it
and
even
more
indifferent
about
his
promotion
the
order
for
which
had
still
not
arrived
accompanied
by
vanyusha
he
rode
back
to
the
cordon
without
any
accident
several
hours
in
advance
of
the
rest
of
the
company
he
spent
the
whole
evening
in
his
porch
watching
maryanka
and
he
again
walked
about
the
yard
without
aim
or
thought
all
night
chapter
xxxiii
it
was
late
when
he
awoke
the
next
day
his
hosts
were
no
longer
in
he
did
not
go
shooting
but
now
took
up
a
book
and
now
went
out
into
the
porch
and
now
again
the
hut
and
lay
down
on
the
bed
vanyusha
thought
he
was
ill
towards
evening
olenin
got
up
resolutely
began
writing
and
wrote
on
till
late
at
night
he
wrote
a
letter
but
did
not
post
it
because
he
felt
that
no
one
would
have
understood
what
he
wanted
to
say
and
besides
it
was
not
necessary
that
anyone
but
himself
should
understand
it
this
is
what
he
wrote
receive
letters
of
condolence
from
russia
they
are
afraid
that
i
shall
perish
buried
in
these
wilds
they
say
about
me
he
will
become
coarse
he
will
be
behind
the
times
in
everything
he
will
take
to
drink
and
who
knows
but
that
he
may
marry
a
cossack
girl
it
was
not
for
nothing
they
say
that
ermolov
declared
anyone
serving
in
the
caucasus
for
ten
years
either
becomes
a
confirmed
drunkard
or
marries
a
loose
woman
how
terrible
indeed
it
wo
do
for
me
to
ruin
myself
when
i
might
have
the
great
happiness
of
even
becoming
the
countess
b
husband
or
a
court
chamberlain
or
a
marechal
de
noblesse
of
my
district
oh
how
repulsive
and
pitiable
you
all
seem
to
me
you
do
not
know
what
happiness
is
and
what
life
is
one
must
taste
life
once
in
all
its
natural
beauty
must
see
and
understand
what
i
see
every
day
before
me
those
eternally
unapproachable
snowy
peaks
and
a
majestic
woman
in
that
primitive
beauty
in
which
the
first
woman
must
have
come
from
her
creator
hands
and
then
it
becomes
clear
who
is
ruining
himself
and
who
is
living
truly
or
falsely
you
or
i
if
you
only
knew
how
despicable
and
pitiable
you
in
your
delusions
seem
to
me
when
i
picture
to
myself
in
place
of
my
hut
my
forests
and
my
love
those
those
women
with
their
hair
eked
out
with
false
curls
those
unnaturally
grimacing
lips
those
hidden
feeble
distorted
limbs
and
that
chatter
of
obligatory
conversation
which
has
no
right
to
the
name
i
feel
unendurably
revolted
i
then
see
before
me
those
obtuse
faces
those
rich
eligible
girls
whose
looks
seem
to
say
it
all
right
you
may
come
near
though
i
am
rich
and
eligible
and
that
arranging
and
rearranging
of
seats
that
shameless
and
that
eternal
and
pretence
those
rules
with
whom
to
shake
hands
to
whom
only
to
nod
with
whom
to
converse
and
all
this
done
deliberately
with
a
conviction
of
its
inevitability
that
continual
ennui
in
the
blood
passing
on
from
generation
to
generation
try
to
understand
or
believe
just
this
one
thing
you
need
only
see
and
comprehend
what
truth
and
beauty
are
and
all
that
you
now
say
and
think
and
all
your
wishes
for
me
and
for
yourselves
will
fly
to
atoms
happiness
is
being
with
nature
seeing
her
and
conversing
with
her
he
may
even
god
forbid
marry
a
common
cossack
girl
and
be
quite
lost
socially
i
can
imagine
them
saying
of
me
with
sincere
pity
yet
the
one
thing
i
desire
is
to
be
quite
lost
in
your
sense
of
the
word
i
wish
to
marry
a
cossack
girl
and
dare
not
because
it
would
be
a
height
of
happiness
of
which
i
am
unworthy
months
have
passed
since
i
first
saw
the
cossack
girl
maryanka
the
views
and
prejudices
of
the
world
i
had
left
were
still
fresh
in
me
i
did
not
then
believe
that
i
could
love
that
woman
i
delighted
in
her
beauty
just
as
i
delighted
in
the
beauty
of
the
mountains
and
the
sky
nor
could
i
help
delighting
in
her
for
she
is
as
beautiful
as
they
i
found
that
the
sight
of
her
beauty
had
become
a
necessity
of
my
life
and
i
began
asking
myself
whether
i
did
not
love
her
but
i
could
find
nothing
within
myself
at
all
like
love
as
i
had
imagined
it
to
be
mine
was
not
the
restlessness
of
loneliness
and
desire
for
marriage
nor
was
it
platonic
still
less
a
carnal
love
such
as
i
have
experienced
i
needed
only
to
see
her
to
hear
her
to
know
that
she
was
near
and
if
i
was
not
happy
i
was
at
peace
an
evening
gathering
at
which
i
met
her
and
touched
her
i
felt
that
between
that
woman
and
myself
there
existed
an
indissoluble
though
unacknowledged
bond
against
which
i
could
not
struggle
yet
i
did
struggle
i
asked
myself
is
it
possible
to
love
a
woman
who
will
never
understand
the
profoundest
interests
of
my
life
is
it
possible
to
love
a
woman
simply
for
her
beauty
to
love
the
statue
of
a
woman
but
i
was
already
in
love
with
her
though
i
did
not
yet
trust
to
my
feelings
that
evening
when
i
first
spoke
to
her
our
relations
changed
before
that
she
had
been
to
me
an
extraneous
but
majestic
object
of
external
nature
but
since
then
she
has
become
a
human
being
i
began
to
meet
her
to
talk
to
her
and
sometimes
to
go
to
work
for
her
father
and
to
spend
whole
evenings
with
them
and
in
this
intimate
intercourse
she
remained
still
in
my
eyes
just
as
pure
inaccessible
and
majestic
she
always
responded
with
equal
calm
pride
and
cheerful
equanimity
sometimes
she
was
friendly
but
generally
her
every
look
every
word
and
every
movement
expressed
equanimity
not
contemptuous
but
crushing
and
bewitching
every
day
with
a
feigned
smile
on
my
lips
i
tried
to
play
a
part
and
with
torments
of
passion
and
desire
in
my
heart
i
spoke
banteringly
to
her
she
saw
that
i
was
dissembling
but
looked
straight
at
me
cheerfully
and
simply
this
position
became
unbearable
i
wished
not
to
deceive
her
but
to
tell
her
all
i
thought
and
felt
i
was
extremely
agitated
we
were
in
the
vineyard
when
i
began
to
tell
her
of
my
love
in
words
i
am
now
ashamed
to
remember
i
am
ashamed
because
i
ought
not
to
have
dared
to
speak
so
to
her
because
she
stood
far
above
such
words
and
above
the
feeling
they
were
meant
to
express
i
said
no
more
but
from
that
day
my
position
has
been
intolerable
i
did
not
wish
to
demean
myself
by
continuing
our
former
flippant
relations
and
at
the
same
time
i
felt
that
i
had
not
yet
reached
the
level
of
straight
and
simple
relations
with
her
i
asked
myself
despairingly
what
am
i
to
do
in
foolish
dreams
i
imagined
her
now
as
my
mistress
and
now
as
my
wife
but
rejected
both
ideas
with
disgust
to
make
her
a
wanton
woman
would
be
dreadful
it
would
be
murder
to
turn
her
into
a
fine
lady
the
wife
of
dmitri
andreich
olenin
like
a
cossack
woman
here
who
is
married
to
one
of
our
officers
would
be
still
worse
now
could
i
turn
cossack
like
lukashka
and
steal
horses
get
drunk
on
chikhir
sing
rollicking
songs
kill
people
and
when
drunk
climb
in
at
her
window
for
the
night
without
a
thought
of
who
and
what
i
am
it
would
be
different
then
we
might
understand
one
another
and
i
might
be
happy
tried
to
throw
myself
into
that
kind
of
life
but
was
still
more
conscious
of
my
own
weakness
and
artificiality
i
can
not
forget
myself
and
my
complex
distorted
past
and
my
future
appears
to
me
still
more
hopeless
every
day
i
have
before
me
the
distant
snowy
mountains
and
this
majestic
happy
woman
but
not
for
me
is
the
only
happiness
possible
in
the
world
i
can
not
have
this
woman
what
is
most
terrible
and
yet
sweetest
in
my
condition
is
that
i
feel
that
i
understand
her
but
that
she
will
never
understand
me
not
because
she
is
inferior
on
the
contrary
she
ought
not
to
understand
me
she
is
happy
she
is
like
nature
consistent
calm
and
and
i
a
weak
distorted
being
want
her
to
understand
my
deformity
and
my
torments
i
have
not
slept
at
night
but
have
aimlessly
passed
under
her
windows
not
rendering
account
to
myself
of
what
was
happening
to
me
on
the
our
company
started
on
a
raid
and
i
spent
three
days
away
from
the
village
i
was
sad
and
apathetic
the
usual
songs
cards
and
talk
of
rewards
in
the
regiment
were
more
repulsive
to
me
than
usual
yesterday
i
returned
home
and
saw
her
my
hut
daddy
eroshka
and
the
snowy
mountains
from
my
porch
and
was
seized
by
such
a
strong
new
feeling
of
joy
that
i
understood
it
all
i
love
this
woman
i
feel
real
love
for
the
first
and
only
time
in
my
life
i
know
what
has
befallen
me
i
do
not
fear
to
be
degraded
by
this
feeling
i
am
not
ashamed
of
my
love
i
am
proud
of
it
it
is
not
my
fault
that
i
love
it
has
come
about
against
my
will
i
tried
to
escape
from
my
love
by
and
tried
to
devise
a
joy
in
the
cossack
lukashka
and
maryanka
love
but
thereby
only
stirred
up
my
own
love
and
jealousy
this
is
not
the
ideal
the
exalted
love
which
i
have
known
before
not
that
sort
of
attachment
in
which
you
admire
your
own
love
and
feel
that
the
source
of
your
emotion
is
within
yourself
and
do
everything
yourself
i
have
felt
that
too
it
is
still
less
a
desire
for
enjoyment
it
is
something
different
perhaps
in
her
i
love
nature
the
personification
of
all
that
is
beautiful
in
nature
but
yet
i
am
not
acting
by
my
own
will
but
some
elemental
force
loves
through
me
the
whole
of
god
world
all
nature
presses
this
love
into
my
soul
and
says
love
her
i
love
her
not
with
my
mind
or
my
imagination
but
with
my
whole
being
loving
her
i
feel
myself
to
be
an
integral
part
of
all
god
joyous
world
i
wrote
before
about
the
new
convictions
to
which
my
solitary
life
had
brought
me
but
no
one
knows
with
what
labour
they
shaped
themselves
within
me
and
with
what
joy
i
realized
them
and
saw
a
new
way
of
life
opening
out
before
me
nothing
was
dearer
to
me
than
those
convictions
well
love
has
come
and
neither
they
nor
any
regrets
for
them
remain
it
is
even
difficult
for
me
to
believe
that
i
could
prize
such
a
cold
and
abstract
state
of
mind
beauty
came
and
scattered
to
the
winds
all
that
laborious
inward
toil
and
no
regret
remains
for
what
has
vanished
is
all
nonsense
and
absurdity
that
is
pride
a
refuge
from
unhappiness
and
salvation
from
the
envy
of
others
happiness
live
for
others
and
do
good
why
when
in
my
soul
there
is
only
love
for
myself
and
the
desire
to
love
her
and
to
live
her
life
with
her
not
for
others
not
for
lukashka
i
now
desire
happiness
i
do
not
now
love
those
others
formerly
i
should
have
told
myself
that
this
is
wrong
i
should
have
tormented
myself
with
the
questions
what
will
become
of
her
of
me
and
of
lukashka
now
i
do
care
i
do
not
live
my
own
life
there
is
something
stronger
than
me
which
directs
me
i
suffer
but
formerly
i
was
dead
and
only
now
do
i
live
today
i
will
go
to
their
house
and
tell
her
everything
chapter
xxxiv
late
that
evening
after
writing
this
letter
olenin
went
to
his
hut
the
old
woman
was
sitting
on
a
bench
behind
the
oven
unwinding
cocoons
maryanka
with
her
head
uncovered
sat
sewing
by
the
light
of
a
candle
on
seeing
olenin
she
jumped
up
took
her
kerchief
and
stepped
to
the
oven
dear
said
her
mother
you
sit
here
with
me
a
bit
i
bareheaded
she
replied
and
sprang
up
on
the
oven
olenin
could
only
see
a
knee
and
one
of
her
shapely
legs
hanging
down
from
the
oven
he
treated
the
old
woman
to
tea
she
treated
her
guest
to
clotted
cream
which
she
sent
maryanka
to
fetch
but
having
put
a
plateful
on
the
table
maryanka
again
sprang
on
the
oven
from
whence
olenin
felt
her
eyes
upon
him
they
talked
about
household
matters
granny
ulitka
became
animated
and
went
into
raptures
of
hospitality
she
brought
olenin
preserved
grapes
and
a
grape
tart
and
some
of
her
best
wine
and
pressed
him
to
eat
and
drink
with
the
rough
yet
proud
hospitality
of
country
folk
only
found
among
those
who
produce
their
bread
by
the
labour
of
their
own
hands
the
old
woman
who
had
at
first
struck
olenin
so
much
by
her
rudeness
now
often
touched
him
by
her
simple
tenderness
towards
her
daughter
we
need
not
offend
the
lord
by
grumbling
we
have
enough
of
everything
thank
god
we
have
pressed
sufficient
chikhir
and
have
preserved
and
shall
sell
three
or
four
barrels
of
grapes
and
have
enough
left
to
drink
do
be
in
a
hurry
to
leave
us
we
will
make
merry
together
at
the
wedding
when
is
the
wedding
to
be
asked
olenin
feeling
his
blood
suddenly
rush
to
his
face
while
his
heart
beat
irregularly
and
painfully
he
heard
a
movement
on
the
oven
and
the
sound
of
seeds
being
cracked
you
know
it
ought
to
be
next
week
we
are
quite
ready
replied
the
old
woman
as
simply
and
quietly
as
though
olenin
did
not
exist
have
prepared
and
have
procured
everything
for
maryanka
we
will
give
her
away
properly
only
there
one
thing
not
quite
right
our
lukashka
has
been
running
rather
wild
he
has
been
too
much
on
the
spree
up
to
tricks
the
other
day
a
cossack
came
here
from
his
company
and
said
he
had
been
to
nogay
must
mind
he
does
not
get
caught
said
olenin
that
what
i
tell
him
mind
lukashka
do
you
get
into
mischief
well
of
course
a
young
fellow
naturally
wants
to
cut
a
dash
but
there
a
time
for
everything
well
you
captured
or
stolen
something
and
killed
an
abrek
well
you
a
fine
fellow
but
now
you
should
live
quietly
for
a
bit
or
else
there
be
trouble
i
saw
him
a
time
or
two
in
the
division
he
was
always
he
has
sold
another
horse
said
olenin
and
glanced
towards
the
oven
a
pair
of
large
dark
and
hostile
eyes
glittered
as
they
gazed
severely
at
him
he
became
ashamed
of
what
he
had
said
of
it
he
does
no
one
any
harm
suddenly
remarked
maryanka
makes
merry
with
his
own
money
and
lowering
her
legs
she
jumped
down
from
the
oven
and
went
out
banging
the
door
olenin
followed
her
with
his
eyes
as
long
as
she
was
in
the
hut
and
then
looked
at
the
door
and
waited
understanding
nothing
of
what
granny
ulitka
was
telling
him
a
few
minutes
later
some
visitors
arrived
an
old
man
granny
brother
with
daddy
eroshka
and
following
them
came
maryanka
and
ustenka
evening
squeaked
ustenka
on
holiday
she
added
turning
to
olenin
still
on
holiday
he
replied
and
felt
he
did
not
know
why
ashamed
and
ill
at
ease
he
wished
to
go
away
but
could
not
it
also
seemed
to
him
impossible
to
remain
silent
the
old
man
helped
him
by
asking
for
a
drink
and
they
had
a
drink
olenin
drank
with
eroshka
with
the
other
cossack
and
again
with
eroshka
and
the

he
drank
the
heavier
was
his
heart
but
the
two
old
men
grew
merry
the
girls
climbed
onto
the
oven
where
they
sat
whispering
and
looking
at
the
men
who
drank
till
it
was
late
olenin
did
not
talk
but
drank
more
than
the
others
the
cossacks
were
shouting
the
old
woman
would
not
let
them
have
any
more
chikhir
and
at
last
turned
them
out
the
girls
laughed
at
daddy
eroshka
and
it
was
past
ten
when
they
all
went
out
into
the
porch
the
old
men
invited
themselves
to
finish
their
at
olenin
ustenka
ran
off
home
and
eroshka
led
the
old
cossack
to
vanyusha
the
old
woman
went
out
to
tidy
up
the
shed
maryanka
remained
alone
in
the
hut
olenin
felt
fresh
and
joyous
as
if
he
had
only
just
woke
up
he
noticed
everything
and
having
let
the
old
men
pass
ahead
he
turned
back
to
the
hut
where
maryanka
was
preparing
for
bed
he
went
up
to
her
and
wished
to
say
something
but
his
voice
broke
she
moved
away
from
him
sat
down
on
her
bed
in
the
corner
and
looked
at
him
silently
with
wild
and
frightened
eyes
she
was
evidently
afraid
of
him
olenin
felt
this
he
felt
sorry
and
ashamed
of
himself
and
at
the
same
time
proud
and
pleased
that
he
aroused
even
that
feeling
in
her
he
said
you
never
take
pity
on
me
i
ca
tell
you
how
i
love
you
she
moved
still
farther
away
hear
how
the
wine
is
speaking
you
get
nothing
from
me
it
is
not
the
wine
do
marry
lukashka
i
will
marry
you
am
i
saying
he
thought
as
he
uttered
these
words
i
be
able
to
say
the
same
i
shall
i
am
sure
i
shall
and
i
will
repeat
them
now
replied
an
inner
voice
you
marry
me
she
looked
at
him
seriously
and
her
fear
seemed
to
have
passed
i
shall
go
out
of
my
mind
i
am
not
myself
i
will
do
whatever
you
command
and
madly
tender
words
came
from
his
lips
of
their
own
accord
then
what
are
you
drivelling
about
she
interrupted
suddenly
seizing
the
arm
he
was
stretching
towards
her
she
did
not
push
his
arm
away
but
pressed
it
firmly
with
her
strong
hard
fingers
gentlemen
marry
cossack
girls
go
away
will
you
everything
what
shall
we
do
with
lukashka
said
she
laughing
he
snatched
away
the
arm
she
was
holding
and
firmly
embraced
her
young
body
but
she
sprang
away
like
a
fawn
and
ran
barefoot
into
the
porch
olenin
came
to
his
senses
and
was
terrified
at
himself
he
again
felt
himself
inexpressibly
vile
compared
to
her
yet
not
repenting
for
an
instant
of
what
he
had
said
he
went
home
and
without
even
glancing
at
the
old
men
who
were
drinking
in
his
room
he
lay
down
and
fell
asleep
more
soundly
than
he
had
done
for
a
long
time

xxxv
the
next
day
was
a
holiday
in
the
evening
all
the
villagers
their
holiday
clothes
shining
in
the
sunset
were
out
in
the
street
that
season
more
wine
than
usual
had
been
produced
and
the
people
were
now
free
from
their
labours
in
a
month
the
cossacks
were
to
start
on
a
campaign
and
in
many
families
preparations
were
being
made
for
weddings
most
of
the
people
were
standing
in
the
square
in
front
of
the
cossack
government
office
and
near
the
two
shops
in
one
of
which
cakes
and
pumpkin
seeds
were
sold
in
the
other
kerchiefs
and
cotton
prints
on
the
of
the
sat
or
stood
the
old
men
in
sober
grey
or
black
coats
without
gold
trimmings
or
any
kind
of
ornament
they
conversed
among
themselves
quietly
in
measured
tones
about
the
harvest
about
the
young
folk
about
village
affairs
and
about
old
times
looking
with
dignified
equanimity
at
the
younger
generation
passing
by
them
the
women
and
girls
stopped
and
bent
their
heads
the
young
cossacks
respectfully
slackened
their
pace
and
raised
their
caps
holding
them
for
a
while
over
their
heads
the
old
men
then
stopped
speaking
some
of
them
watched
the
severely
others
kindly
and
in
their
turn
slowly
took
off
their
caps
and
put
them
on
again
the
cossack
girls
had
not
yet
started
dancing
their
khorovods
but
having
gathered
in
groups
in
their
bright
coloured
beshmets
with
white
kerchiefs
on
their
heads
pulled
down
to
their
eyes
they
sat
either
on
the
ground
or
on
the
about
the
huts
sheltered
from
the
oblique
rays
of
the
sun
and
laughed
and
chattered
in
their
ringing
voices
little
boys
and
girls
playing
in
the
square
sent
their
balls
high
up
into
the
clear
sky
and
ran
about
squealing
and
shouting
the
girls
had
started
dancing
their
khorovods
and
were
timidly
singing
in
their
thin
shrill
voices
clerks
lads
not
in
the
service
or
home
for
the
holiday
and
wearing
smart
white
or
new
red
circassian
coats
went
about
arm
in
arm
in
twos
or
threes
from
one
group
of
women
or
girls
to
another
and
stopped
to
joke
and
chat
with
the
cossack
girls
the
armenian
shopkeeper
in
a
coat
of
fine
blue
cloth
stood
at
the
open
door
through
which
piles
of
folded
kerchiefs
were
visible
and
conscious
of
his
own
importance
and
with
the
pride
of
an
oriental
tradesman
waited
for
customers
two
barefooted
chechens
who
had
come
from
beyond
the
terek
to
see
the
fete
sat
on
their
heels
outside
the
house
of
a
friend
negligently
smoking
their
little
pipes
and
occasionally
spitting
watching
the
villagers
and
exchanging
remarks
with
one
another
in
their
rapid
guttural
speech
occasionally
a
soldier
in
an
old
overcoat
passed
across
the
square
among
the
girls
here
and
there
the
songs
of
tipsy
cossacks
who
were
could
already
be
heard
all
the
huts
were
closed
the
porches
had
been
scrubbed
clean
the
day
before
even
the
old
women
were
out
in
the
street
which
was
everywhere
sprinkled
with
pumpkin
and
melon
the
air
was
warm
and
still
the
sky
deep
and
clear
beyond
the
roofs
the
mountain
range
which
seemed
very
near
was
turning
rosy
in
the
glow
of
the
evening
sun
now
and
then
from
the
other
side
of
the
river
came
the
distant
roar
of
a
cannon
but
above
the
village
mingling
with
one
another
floated
all
sorts
of
merry
holiday
sounds
olenin
had
been
pacing
the
yard
all
that
morning
hoping
to
see
maryanka
but
she
having
put
on
holiday
clothes
went
to
mass
at
the
chapel
and
afterwards
sat
with
the
other
girls
on
an
cracking
seeds
sometimes
again
together
with
her
companions
she
ran
home
and
each
time
gave
the
lodger
a
bright
and
kindly
look
olenin
felt
afraid
to
address
her
playfully
or
in
the
presence
of
others
he
wished
to
finish
telling
her
what
he
had
begun
to
say
the
night
before
and
to
get
her
to
give
him
a
definite
answer
he
waited
for
another
moment
like
that
of
yesterday
evening
but
the
moment
did
not
come
and
he
felt
that
he
could
not
remain
any
longer
in
this
uncertainty
she
went
out
into
the
street
again
and
after
waiting
awhile
he
too
went
out
and
without
knowing
where
he
was
going
he
followed
her
he
passed
by
the
corner
where
she
was
sitting
in
her
shining
blue
satin
beshmet
and
with
an
aching
heart
he
heard
behind
him
the
girls
laughing
beletski
hut
looked
out
onto
the
square
as
olenin
was
passing
it
he
heard
beletski
voice
calling
to
him
in
and
in
he
went
after
a
short
talk
they
both
sat
down
by
the
window
and
were
soon
joined
by
eroshka
who
entered
dressed
in
a
new
beshmet
and
sat
down
on
the
floor
beside
them
that
the
aristocratic
party
said
beletski
pointing
with
his
cigarette
to
a
brightly
coloured
group
at
the
corner
is
there
too
do
you
see
her
in
red
that
a
new
beshmet
why
do
you
start
the
khorovod
he
shouted
leaning
out
of
the
window
a
bit
and
then
when
it
grows
dark
let
us
go
too
then
we
will
invite
them
to
ustenka
we
must
arrange
a
ball
for
them
i
will
come
to
ustenka
said
olenin
in
a
decided
tone
maryanka
be
there
she
be
there
do
come
said
beletski
without
the
least
surprise
is
it
a
pretty
picture
he
added
pointing
to
the
motley
crowds
very
olenin
assented
trying
to
appear
indifferent
of
this
kind
he
added
make
me
wonder
why
all
these
people
should
suddenly
be
contented
and
jolly
for
instance
just
because
it
happens
to
be
the
fifteenth
of
the
month
everything
is
festive
eyes
and
faces
and
voices
and
movements
and
garments
and
the
air
and
the
sun
are
all
in
a
holiday
mood
and
we
no
longer
have
any
holidays
said
beletski
who
did
not
like
such
reflections
why
are
you
not
drinking
old
fellow
he
said
turning
to
eroshka
eroshka
winked
at
olenin
pointing
to
beletski
he
a
proud
one
that
kunak
of
yours
he
said
beletski
raised
his
glass
allah
birdy
he
said
emptying
it
allah
birdy
has
given
the
usual
greeting
of
caucasians
when
drinking
together
bul
health
answered
eroshka
smiling
and
emptied
his
glass
of
holidays
he
said
turning
to
olenin
as
he
rose
and
looked
out
of
the
window
sort
of
holiday
is
that
you
should
have
seen
them
make
merry
in
the
old
days
the
women
used
to
come
out
in
their
gold
trimmed
sarafans
two
rows
of
gold
coins
hanging
round
their
necks
and
diadems
on
their
heads
and
when
they
passed
they
made
a
noise
flu
flu
with
their
dresses
every
woman
looked
like
a
princess
sometimes
they
come
out
a
whole
herd
of
them
and
begin
singing
songs
so
that
the
air
seemed
to
rumble
and
they
went
on
making
merry
all
night
and
the
cossacks
would
roll
out
a
barrel
into
the
yards
and
sit
down
and
drink
till
break
of
day
or
they
would
go
sweeping
the
village
whoever
they
met
they
seized
and
took
along
with
them
and
went
from
house
to
house
sometimes
they
used
to
make
merry
for
three
days
on
end

to
come
home
i
still

it
quite
red
and

without

having
lost
everything

come
and
lie
down
mother
knew
what
to
do
she
would
bring
him
some
fresh
caviar
and
a
little
chikhir
to
sober
him
up
and
would
herself
run
about
in
the
village
looking
for
his
cap
then
sleep
for
two
days
that
the
sort
of
fellows
they
were
then
but
now
what
are
they
and
the
girls
in
the
sarafans
did
they
make
merry
all
by
themselves
asked
beletski
they
did
sometimes
cossacks
would
come
on
foot
or
on
horse
and
say
let
break
up
the
khorovods
and
they
go
but
the
girls
would
take
up
cudgels
carnival
week
some
young
fellow
would
come
galloping
up
and
they
cudgel
his
horse
and
cudgel
him
too
but
he
break
through

the
one

carry
her
off

his

his
heart
content

the
girls
in
those
days
they
were
regular
queens
chapter
xxxvi
just
then
two
men
rode
out
of
the
side
street
into
the
square
one
of
them
was
nazarka
the
other
lukashka
sat
slightly
sideways
on
his
bay
kabarda
horse
which
stepped
lightly
over
the
hard
road
jerking
its
beautiful
head
with
its
fine
glossy
mane
the
gun
in
its
cover
the
pistol
at
his
back
and
the
cloak
rolled
up
behind
his
saddle
showed
that
lukashka
had
not
come
from
a
peaceful
place
or
from
one
near
by
the
smart
way
in
which
he
sat
a
little
sideways
on
his
horse
the
careless
motion
with
which
he
touched
the
horse
under
its
belly
with
his
whip
and
especially
his
black
eyes
glistening
as
he
looked
proudly
around
him
all
expressed
the
conscious
strength
and
of
youth
seen
as
fine
a
lad
his
eyes
looking
from
side
to
side
seemed
to
say
the
elegant
horse
with
its
silver
ornaments
and
trappings
the
weapons
and
the
handsome
cossack
himself
attracted
the
attention
of
everyone
in
the
square
nazarka
lean
and
short
was
much
less
well
dressed
as
he
rode
past
the
old
men
lukashka
paused
and
raised
his
curly
white
sheepskin
cap
above
his
closely
cropped
black
head
have
you
carried
off
many
nogay
horses
asked
a
lean
old
man
with
a
frowning
lowering
look
you
counted
them
grandad
that
you
ask
replied
lukashka
turning
away
all
very
well
but
you
need
not
take
my
lad
along
with
you
the
old
man
muttered
with
a
still
darker
frown
see
the
old
devil
he
knows
everything
muttered
lukashka
to
himself
and
a
worried
expression
came
over
his
face
but
then
noticing
a
corner
where
a
number
of
cossack
girls
were
standing
he
turned
his
horse
towards
them
evening
girls
he
shouted
in
his
powerful
resonant
voice
suddenly
checking
his
horse
grown
old
without
me
you
witches
and
he
laughed
evening
lukashka
good
evening
laddie
the
merry
voices
answered
you
brought
much
money
buy
some
sweets
for
the
girls
have
you
come
for
long
true
enough
it
long
since
we
saw
you
and
i
have
just
flown
across
to
make
a
night
of
it
replied
lukashka
raising
his
whip
and
riding
straight
at
the
girls
maryanka
has
quite
forgotten
you
said
ustenka
nudging
maryanka
with
her
elbow
and
breaking
into
a
shrill
laugh
maryanka
moved
away
from
the
horse
and
throwing
back
her
head
calmly
looked
at
the
cossack
with
her
large
sparkling
eyes
enough
you
have
not
been
home
for
a
long
time
why
are
you
trampling
us
under
your
horse
she
remarked
dryly
and
turned
away
lukashka
had
appeared
particularly
merry
his
face
shone
with
audacity
and
joy
obviously
staggered
by
maryanka
cold
reply
he
suddenly
knitted
his
brow
up
on
my
stirrup
and
i
carry
you
away
to
the
mountains
mammy
he
suddenly
exclaimed
and
as
if
to
disperse
his
dark
thoughts
he
caracoled
among
the
girls
stooping
down
towards
maryanka
he
said
kiss
oh
how
i
kiss
you
maryanka
eyes
met
his
and
she
suddenly
blushed
and
stepped
back
bother
you
you
crush
my
feet
she
said
and
bending
her
head
looked
at
her
feet
in
their
tightly
fitting
light
blue
stockings
with
clocks
and
her
new
red
slippers
trimmed
with
narrow
silver
braid
lukashka
turned
towards
ustenka
and
maryanka
sat
down
next
to
a
woman
with
a
baby
in
her
arms
the
baby
stretched
his
plump
little
hands
towards
the
girl
and
seized
a
necklace
string
that
hung
down
onto
her
blue
beshmet
maryanka
bent
towards
the
child
and
glanced
at
lukashka
from
the
corner
of
her
eyes
lukashka
just
then
was
getting
out
from
under
his
coat
from
the
pocket
of
his
black
beshmet
a
bundle
of
sweetmeats
and
seeds
i
give
them
to
all
of
you
he
said
handing
the
bundle
to
ustenka
and
smiling
at
maryanka
a
confused
expression
again
appeared
on
the
girl
face
it
was
as
though
a
mist
gathered
over
her
beautiful
eyes
she
drew
her
kerchief
down
below
her
lips
and
leaning
her
head
over
the
face
of
the
baby
that
still
held
her
by
her
coin
necklace
she
suddenly
began
to
kiss
it
greedily
the
baby
pressed
his
little
hands
against
the
high
breasts
and
opening
his
toothless
mouth
screamed
loudly
you
smothering
the
boy
said
the
little
one
mother
taking
him
away
and
she
unfastened
her
beshmet
to
give
him
the
breast
better
have
a
chat
with
the
young
fellow
i
only
go
and
put
up
my
horse
and
then
nazarka
and
i
will
come
back
we
make
merry
all
night
said
lukashka
touching
his
horse
with
his
whip
and
riding
away
from
the
girls
turning
into
a
side
street
he
and
nazarka
rode
up
to
two
huts
that
stood
side
by
side
here
we
are
all
right
old
fellow
be
quick
and
come
soon
called
lukashka
to
his
comrade
dismounting
in
front
of
one
of
the
huts
then
he
carefully
led
his
horse
in
at
the
gate
of
the
wattle
fence
of
his
own
home
how
do
stepka
he
said
to
his
dumb
sister
who
smartly
dressed
like
the
others
came
in
from
the
street
to
take
his
horse
and
he
made
signs
to
her
to
take
the
horse
to
the
hay
but
not
to
unsaddle
it
the
dumb
girl
made
her
usual
humming
noise
smacked
her
lips
as
she
pointed
to
the
horse
and
kissed
it
on
the
nose
as
much
as
to
say
that
she
loved
it
and
that
it
was
a
fine
horse
how
do
mother
how
is
it
that
you
have
not
gone
out

shouted
lukashka
holding
his
gun
in
place
as
he
mounted
the
steps
of
the
porch
his
old
mother
opened
the
door
dear
me
i
never
expected

thought

the
old

the
old
woman

she
took
her
keys
and
hurriedly
went
to
the
outhouse
nazarka
after
putting
up
his
horse
and
taking
the
gun
off
his
shoulder
returned
to
lukashka
house
and
went

said
lukashka
taking
from
his
mother
hands
a
cup
filled
to
the
brim
with
chikhir
and
carefully
raising
it
to
his
bowed
head
bad

said
nazarka

how
daddy
burlak
said

seems
to
know
regular

lukashka
replied
shortly
what
of
it
he
added
tossing
his
head

now
let
make
merry
drink
shouted
lukashka
just
in
the
tone
in
which
old
eroshka
uttered
the
word
go
out
into
the
street
and
make
merry
with
the
girls
you

and

dumb
wench

till

nazarka
smiled
we
stopping
here
long
he
asked
till
we
had
a
bit
of
fun
run
and
get
some
vodka
here
the
money
nazarka
ran
off
obediently
to
get
the
vodka
from
yamka
daddy
eroshka
and
ergushov
like
birds
of
prey
scenting
where
the
was
going
on
tumbled
into
the
hut
one
after
the
other
both
tipsy
us
another
shouted
lukashka
to
his
mother
by
way
of
reply
to
their
greeting
then
tell
us
where
did
you
steal
them
you
devil
shouted
eroshka
fellow
i
fond
of
you
indeed
answered
lukashka
laughing
sweets
from
cadets
to
lasses
eh
you
old
not
true
not
true
oh
mark
and
the
old
man
burst
out
laughing
how
that
devil
begged
me
go
he
said
and
arrange
it
he
offered
me
a
gun
but
no
i
have
managed
it
but
i
feel
for
you
now
tell
us
where
have
you
been
and
the
old
man
began
speaking
in
tartar
lukashka
answered
him
promptly
ergushov
who
did
not
know
much
tartar
only
occasionally
put
in
a
word
in
russian
i
say
is
he
driven
away
the
horses
i
know
it
for
a
fact
he
chimed
in
and
i
went
together
his
speaking
of
girey
khan
as
was
to
the
cossack
mind
evidence
of
his
boldness
beyond
the
river
he
kept
bragging
that
he
knew
the
whole
of
the
steppe
and
would
lead
the
way
straight
but
we
rode
on
and
the
night
was
dark
and
my
girey
lost
his
way
and
began
wandering
in
a
circle
without
getting
anywhere
could
find
the
village
and
there
we
were
we
must
have
gone
too
much
to
the
right
i
believe
we
wandered
about
well
nigh
till
midnight
then
thank
goodness
we
heard
dogs
howling
said
daddy
eroshka
now
we
too
used
to
lose
our
way
in
the
steppe
who
the
devil
can
follow
it
but
i
used
to
ride
up
a
hillock
and
start
howling
like
the
wolves
like
this
he
placed
his
hands
before
his
mouth
and
howled
like
a
pack
of
wolves
all
on
one
note
dogs
would
answer
at
once
well
go
on
so
you
found
them
soon
led
them
away
nazarka
was
nearly
caught
by
some
nogay
women
he
was
indeed
nazarka
who
had
just
come
back
said
in
an
injured
tone
rode
off
again
and
again
girey
lost
his
way
and
almost
landed
us
among
the
we
thought
we
were
just
getting
to
the
terek
but
we
were
riding
away
from
it
all
the
time
should
have
steered
by
the
stars
said
daddy
eroshka
what
i
say
interjected
ergushov
steer
when
all
is
black
i
tried
and
tried
all
about
and
at
last
i
put
the
bridle
on
one
of
the
mares
and
let
my
own
horse
go
free
thinking
he
lead
us
out
and
what
do
you
think
he
just
gave
a
snort
or
two
with
his
nose
to
the
ground
galloped
ahead
and
led
us
straight
to
our
village
thank
goodness
it
was
getting
quite
light
we
barely
had
time
to
hide
them
in
the
forest
nagim
came
across
the
river
and
took
them
away
ergushov
shook
his
head
just
what
i
said
smart
did
you
get
much
for
them
all
here
said
lukashka
slapping
his
pocket
just
then
his
mother
came
into
the
room
and
lukashka
did
not
finish
what
he
was
saying
he
shouted
too
girich
and
i
rode
out
late
one
night
began
eroshka
bother
we
never
hear
the
end
of
you
said
lukashka
am
going
and
having
emptied
his
cup
and
tightened
the
strap
of
his
belt
he
went
out
chapter
xxxviii
it
was
already
dark
when
lukashka
went
out
into
the
street
the
autumn
night
was
fresh
and
calm
the
full
golden
moon
floated
up
behind
the
tall
dark
poplars
that
grew
on
one
side
of
the
square
from
the
chimneys
of
the
outhouses
smoke
rose
and
spread
above
the
village
mingling
with
the
mist
here
and
there
lights
shone
through
the
windows
and
the
air
was
laden
with
the
smell
of
kisyak
and
mist
the
sounds
of
voices
laughter
songs
and
the
cracking
of
seeds
mingled
just
as
they
had
done
in
the
daytime
but
were
now
more
distinct
clusters
of
white
kerchiefs
and
caps
gleamed
through
the
darkness
near
the
houses
and
by
the
fences
in
the
square
before
the
shop
door
which
was
lit
up
and
open
the
black
and
white
figures
of
cossack
men
and
maids
showed
through
the
darkness
and
one
heard
from
afar
their
loud
songs
and
laughter
and
talk
the
girls
hand
in
hand
went
round
and
round
in
a
circle
stepping
lightly
in
the
dusty
square
a
skinny
girl
the
plainest
of
them
all
set
the
tune
beyond
the
wood
from
the
forest
dark
from
the
garden
green
and
the
shady
park
there
came
out
one
day
two
young
lads
so
gay
young
bachelors
hey
brave
and
smart
were
they
and
they
walked
and
walked
then
stood
still
each
man
and
they
talked
and
soon
to
dispute
began
then
a
maid
came
out
as
she
came
along
said
to
one
of
you
i
shall
soon
belong
was
the
lad
got
the
maiden
fair
yes
the
lad
with
the
golden
hair
her
right
hand
so
white
in
his
own
took
he
and
he
led
her
round
for
his
mates
to
see
and
said
have
you
ever
in
all
your
life
met
a
lass
as
fair
as
my
sweet
little
wife
the
old
women
stood
round
listening
to
the
songs
the
little
boys
and
girls
ran
about
chasing
one
another
in
the
dark
the
men
stood
by
catching
at
the
girls
as
the
latter
moved
round
and
sometimes
breaking
the
ring
and
entering
it
on
the
dark
side
of
the
doorway
stood
beletski
and
olenin
in
their
circassian
coats
and
sheepskin
caps
and
talked
together
in
a
style
of
speech
unlike
that
of
the
cossacks
in
low
but
distinct
tones
conscious
that
they
were
attracting
attention
next
to
one
another
in
the
khorovod
circle
moved
plump
little
ustenka
in
her
red
beshmet
and
the
stately
maryanka
in
her
new
smock
and
beshmet
olenin
and
beletski
were
discussing
how
to
snatch
ustenka
and
maryanka
out
of
the
ring
beletski
thought
that
olenin
wished
only
to
amuse
himself
but
olenin
was
expecting
his
fate
to
be
decided
he
wanted
at
any
cost
to
see
maryanka
alone
that
very
day
and
to
tell
her
everything
and
ask
her
whether
she
could
and
would
be
his
wife
although
that
question
had
long
been
answered
in
the
negative
in
his
own
mind
he
hoped
he
would
be
able
to
tell
her
all
he
felt
and
that
she
would
understand
him
did
you
not
tell
me
sooner
said
beletski
would
have
got
ustenka
to
arrange
it
for
you
you
are
such
a
queer
fellow
to
be
done
some
day
very
soon
i
tell
you
all
about
it
only
now
for
heaven
sake
arrange
so
that
she
should
come
to
ustenka
right
that
easily
done
well
maryanka
will
you
belong
to
the
lad
and
not
to
lukashka
said
beletski
speaking
to
maryanka
first
for
propriety
sake
but
having
received
no
reply
he
went
up
to
ustenka
and
begged
her
to
bring
maryanka
home
with
her
he
had
hardly
time
to
finish
what
he
was
saying
before
the
leader
began
another
song
and
the
girls
started
pulling
each
other
round
in
the
ring
by
the
hand
they
sang
past
the
garden
by
the
garden
a
young
man
came
strolling
down
up
the
street
and
through
the
town
and
the
first
time
as
he
passed
he
did
wave
his
strong
right
hand
as
the
second
time
he
passed
waved
his
hat
with
silken
band
but
the
third
time
as
he
went
he
stood
still
before
her
bent
how

it
that

and
started
walking
about
among
the
girls

joined
in
the
singing
taking
seconds
in
his
clear
voice
as

middle
of
the
ring
swinging
his
arms

he
said
the
other
girls
pushed
maryanka
but
she
would
not
enter
the
ring
the
sound
of
shrill
laughter
slaps
kisses
and
whispers
mingled
with
the
singing
as
he
went
past
olenin
lukashka
gave
a
friendly
nod
andreich
have

said

stooped
and
whispered
something
into
ustenka
ear
she
had
not
time
to
reply
till
she
came
round
again

through

darkness
her
eyes
gleamed
brightly
and
kindly
at
the
young
man
he
still
followed
her
he
enjoyed
stooping
closer
to
her
but
lukashka
without
ceasing
to
sing
suddenly
seized
her
firmly
by
the
hand
and
pulled
her
from
her
place
in
the
ring
of

a
great
deal

sweetmeats
to
the
girls

proud
comically
pathetic
but
anyone
who

an
angry
glance
at

his
sweetmeats
from

and
laughing
struggled
for
them
among

generosity
took
off

and
wiping

to
maryanka
and

said
in
the
words
of
the
song
they
had
just
been
singing
and
turning
to
maryanka
he
angrily
repeated
the
words

tore
herself
away
and
swinging

a
blow
on
the
back
that
she
hurt

beletski
along
we
must
prepare
the
ball
chapter
xxxix
it
was
already
late
in
the
night
when
olenin
came
out
of
beletski
hut
following
maryanka
and
ustenka
he
saw
in
the
dark
street
before
him
the
gleam
of
the
girl
white
kerchief
the
golden
moon
was
descending
towards
the
steppe
a
silvery
mist
hung
over
the
village
all
was
still
there
were
no
lights
anywhere
and
one
heard
only
the
receding
footsteps
of
the
young
women
olenin
heart
beat
fast
the
fresh
moist
atmosphere
cooled
his
burning
face
he
glanced
at
the
sky
and
turned
to
look
at
the
hut
he
had
just
come
out
of
the
candle
was
already
out
then
he
again
peered
through
the
darkness
at
the
girls
retreating
shadows
the
white
kerchief
disappeared
in
the
mist
he
was
afraid
to
remain
alone
he
was
so
happy
he
jumped
down
from
the
porch
and
ran
after
the
girls
you
someone
may
see
said
ustenka
mind
olenin
ran
up
to
maryanka
and
embraced
her
maryanka
did
not
resist
you
kissed
enough
yet
said
ustenka
and
then
kiss
but
now
you
better
wait
maryanka
i
will
come
to
see
your
father
and
tell
him
do
you
say
anything
should
i
answered
maryanka
both
the
girls
started
running
olenin
went
on
by
himself
thinking
over
all
that
had
happened
he
had
spent
the
whole
evening
alone
with
her
in
a
corner
by
the
oven
ustenka
had
not
left
the
hut
for
a
single
moment
but
had
romped
about
with
the
other
girls
and
with
beletski
all
the
time
olenin
had
talked
in
whispers
to
maryanka
you
marry
me
he
had
asked
deceive
me
and
not
have
me
she
replied
cheerfully
and
calmly
do
you
love
me
tell
me
for
god
sake
should
i
love
you
you
do
squint
answered
maryanka
laughing
and
with
her
hard
hands
squeezing
his
soft
hands
you
got
so
like
clotted
cream
she
said
am
in
earnest
tell
me
will
you
marry
me
not
if
father
gives
me
to
you
then
remember
i
shall
go
mad
if
you
deceive
me
i
will
tell
your
mother
and
father
i
shall
come
and
propose
maryanka
suddenly
burst
out
laughing
the
matter
seems
so
funny
true
i
will
buy
a
vineyard
and
a
house
and
will
enroll
myself
as
a
cossack
you
do
go
after
other
women
then
i
am
severe
about
that
olenin
joyfully
repeated
all
these
words
to
himself
the
memory
of
them
now
gave
him
pain
and
now
such
joy
that
it
took
away
his
breath
the
pain
was
because
she
had
remained
as
calm
as
usual
while
talking
to
him
she
did
not
seem
at
all
agitated
by
these
new
conditions
it
was
as
if
she
did
not
trust
him
and
did
not
think
of
the
future
it
seemed
to
him
that
she
only
loved
him
for
the
present
moment
and
that
in
her
mind
there
was
no
future
with
him
he
was
happy
because
her
words
sounded
to
him
true
and
she
had
consented
to
be
his
thought
he
to
himself
shall
only
understand
one
another
when
she
is
quite
mine
for
such
love
there
are
no
words
it
needs
life
the
whole
of
life
everything
will
be
cleared
up
i
can
not
live
like
this
any
longer
i
will
tell
everything
to
her
father
to
beletski
and
to
the
whole
village
lukashka
after
two
sleepless
nights
had
drunk
so
much
at
the
fete
that
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
his
feet
would
not
carry
him
and
he
slept
in
yamka
house
chapter
xl
the
next
day
olenin
awoke
earlier
than
usual
and
immediately
remembered
what
lay
before
him
and
he
joyfully
recalled
her
kisses
the
pressure
of
her
hard
hands
and
her
words
white
hands
you
have
he
jumped
up
and
wished
to
go
at
once
to
his
hosts
hut
to
ask
for
their
consent
to
his
marriage
with
maryanka
the
sun
had
not
yet
risen
but
it
seemed
that
there
was
an
unusual
bustle
in
the
street
and
people
were
moving
about
on
foot
and
on
horseback
and
talking
he
threw
on
his
circassian
coat
and
hastened
out
into
the
porch
his
hosts
were
not
yet
up
five
cossacks
were
riding
past
and
talking
loudly
together
in
front
rode
lukashka
on
his
kabarda
horse
the
cossacks
were
all
speaking
and
shouting
so
that
it
was
impossible
to
make
out
exactly
what
they
were
saying
to
the
upper
post
shouted
one
and
catch

middle
gates
of
course
we
must

nearer
that
way
said
one
of
the
cossacks
who
was
covered
with
dust
and
rode
a
perspiring
horse
lukashka
face
was
red
and
swollen
after
the
drinking
of
the
previous
night
and
his
cap
was
pushed
to
the
back
of
his
head
he
was
calling
out
with
authority
as
though
he
were
an
officer
is
the
matter
where
are
you
going
asked
olenin
with
difficulty
attracting
the
cossacks
attention
are
off
to
catch
abreks
they
hiding
among
the
we
are
just
off
but
there
are
not
enough
of
us
yet
and
the
cossacks
continued
to
shout
more
and
more
of
them
joining
as
they
rode
down
the
street
it
occurred
to
olenin
that
it
would
not
look
well
for
him
to
stay
behind
besides
he
thought
he
could
soon
come
back
he
dressed
loaded
his
gun
with
bullets
jumped
onto
his
horse
which
vanyusha
had
saddled
more
or
less
well
and
overtook
the
cossacks
at
the
village
gates
the
cossacks
had
dismounted
and
filling
a
wooden
bowl
with
chikhir
from
a
little
cask
which
they
had
brought
with
them
they
passed
the
bowl
round
to
one
another
and
drank
to
the
success
of
their
expedition
among
them
was
a
smartly
dressed
young
cornet
who
happened
to
be
in
the
village
and
who
took
command
of
the
group
of
nine
cossacks
who
had
joined
for
the
expedition
all
these
cossacks
were
privates
and
although
the
cornet
assumed
the
airs
of
a
commanding
officer
they
only
obeyed
lukashka
of
olenin
they
took
no
notice
at
all
and
when
they
had
all
mounted
and
started
and
olenin
rode
up
to
the
cornet
and
began
asking
him
what
was
taking
place
the
cornet
who
was
usually
quite
friendly
treated
him
with
marked
condescension
it
was
with
great
difficulty
that
olenin
managed
to
find
out
from
him
what
was
happening
scouts
who
had
been
sent
out
to
search
for
abreks
had
come
upon
several
hillsmen
some
six
miles
from
the
village
these
abreks
had
taken
shelter
in
pits
and
had
fired
at
the
scouts
declaring
they
would
not
surrender
a
corporal
who
had
been
scouting
with
two
cossacks
had
remained
to
watch
the
abreks
and
had
sent
one
cossack
back
to
get
help
the
sun
was
just
rising
three
miles
beyond
the
village
the
steppe
spread
out
and
nothing
was
visible
except
the
dry
monotonous
sandy
dismal
plain
covered
with
the
footmarks
of
cattle
and
here
and
there
with
tufts
of
withered
grass
with
low
reeds
in
the
flats
and
rare
footpaths
and
the
camps
of
the
nomad
nogay
tribe
just
visible
far
away
the
absence
of
shade
and
the
austere
aspect
of
the
place
were
striking
the
sun
always
rises
and
sets
red
in
the
steppe
when
it
is
windy
whole
hills
of
sand
are
carried
by
the
wind
from
place
to
place
when
it
is
calm
as
it
was
that
morning
the
silence
uninterrupted
by
any
movement
or
sound
is
peculiarly
striking
that
morning
in
the
steppe
it
was
quiet
and
dull
though
the
sun
had
already
risen
it
all
seemed
specially
soft
and
desolate
the
air
was
hushed
the
footfalls
and
the
snorting
of
the
horses
were
the
only
sounds
to
be
heard
and
even
they
quickly
died
away
the
men
rode
almost
silently
a
cossack
always
carries
his
weapons
so
that
they
neither
jingle
nor
rattle
jingling
weapons
are
a
terrible
disgrace
to
a
cossack
two
other
cossacks
from
the
village
caught
the
party
up
and
exchanged
a
few
words
lukashka
horse
either
stumbled
or
caught
its
foot
in
some
grass
and
became
restive
which
is
a
sign
of
bad
luck
among
the
cossacks
and
at
such
a
time
was
of
special
importance
the
others
exchanged
glances
and
turned
away
trying
not
to
notice
what
had
happened
lukaskha
pulled
at
the
reins
frowned
sternly
set
his
teeth
and
flourished
his
whip
above
his
head
his
good
kabarda
horse
prancing
from
one
foot
to
another
not
knowing
with
which
to
start
seemed
to
wish
to
fly
upwards
on
wings
but
lukashka
hit
its
sides
with
his
whip
once
then
again
and
a
third
time
and
the
horse
showing
its
teeth
and
spreading
out
its
tail
snorted
and
reared
and
stepped
on
its
hind
legs
a
few
paces
away
from
the
others
a
good
steed
that
said
the
cornet
that
he
said
steed
instead
of
horse
indicated
special
praise
lion
of
a
horse
assented
one
of
the
others
an
old
cossack
the
cossacks
rode
forward
silently
now
at
a
footpace
then
at
a
trot
and
these
changes
were
the
only
incidents
that
interrupted
for
a
moment
the
stillness
and
solemnity
of
their
movements
riding
through
the
steppe
for
about
six
miles
they
passed
nothing
but
one
nogay
tent
placed
on
a
cart
and
moving
slowly
along
at
a
distance
of
about
a
mile
from
them
a
nogay
family
was
moving
from
one
part
of
the
steppe
to
another
afterwards
they
met
two
tattered
nogay
women
with
high
cheekbones
who
with
baskets
on
their
backs
were
gathering
dung
left
by
the
cattle
that
wandered
over
the
steppe
the
cornet
who
did
not
know
their
language
well
tried
to
question
them
but
they
did
not
understand
him
and
obviously
frightened
looked
at
one
another
lukashka
rode
up
to
them
both
stopped
his
horse
and
promptly
uttered
the
usual
greeting
the
nogay
women
were
evidently
relieved
and
began
speaking
to
him
quite
freely
as
to
a
brother
ay
kop
abrek
they
said
plaintively
pointing
in
the
direction
in
which
the
cossacks
were
going
olenin
understood
that
they
were
saying
abreks
never
having
seen
an
engagement
of
that
kind
and
having
formed
an
idea
of
them
only
from
daddy
eroshka
tales
olenin
wished
not
to
be
left
behind
by
the
cossacks
but
wanted
to
see
it
all
he
admired
the
cossacks
and
was
on
the
watch
looking
and
listening
and
making
his
own
observations
though
he
had
brought
his
sword
and
a
loaded
gun
with
him
when
he
noticed
that
the
cossacks
avoided
him
he
decided
to
take
no
part
in
the
action
as
in
his
opinion
his
courage
had
already
been
sufficiently
proved
when
he
was
with
his
detachment
and
also
because
he
was
very
happy
suddenly
a
shot
was
heard
in
the
distance
the
cornet
became
excited
and
began
giving
orders
to
the
cossacks
as
to
how
they
should
divide
and
from
which
side
they
should
approach
but
the
cossacks
did
not
appear
to
pay
any
attention
to
these
orders
listening
only
to
what
lukashka
said
and
looking
to
him
alone
lukashka
face
and
figure
were
expressive
of
calm
solemnity
he
put
his
horse
to
a
trot
with
which
the
others
were
unable
to
keep
pace
and
screwing
up
his
eyes
kept
looking
ahead
a
man
on
horseback
he
said
reining
in
his
horse
and
keeping
in
line
with
the
others
olenin
looked
intently
but
could
not
see
anything
the
cossacks
soon
distinguished
two
riders
and
quietly
rode
straight
towards
them
those
the
abreks
asked
olenin
the
cossacks
did
not
answer
his
question
which
appeared
quite
meaningless
to
them
the
abreks
would
have
been
fools
to
venture
across
the
river
on
horseback
friend
rodka
waving
to
us
i
do
believe
said
lukashka
pointing
to
the
two
mounted
men
who
were
now
clearly
visible
he
coming
to
us
a
few
minutes
later
it
became
plain
that
the
two
horsemen
were
the
cossack
scouts
the
corporal
rode
up
to
lukashka
chapter
xli
they
far
was
all
lukashka
said
just
then
they
heard
a
sharp
shot
some
thirty
paces
off
the
corporal
smiled
slightly
gurka
is
having
shots
at
them
he
said
nodding
in
the
direction
of
the
shot
having
gone
a
few
paces
farther
they
saw
gurka
sitting
behind
a
and
loading
his
gun
to
while
away
the
time
he
was
exchanging
shots
with
the
abreks
who
were
behind
another
a
bullet
came
whistling
from
their
side
the
cornet
was
pale
and
grew
confused
lukashka
dismounted
from
his
horse
threw
the
reins
to
one
of
the
other
cossacks
and
went
up
to
gurka
olenin
also
dismounted
and
bending
down
followed
lukashka
they
had
hardly
reached
gurka
when
two
bullets
whistled
above
them
lukashka
looked
around
laughing
at
olenin
and
stooped
a
little
out
or
they
will
kill
you
dmitri
andreich
he
said
better
go
away
you
have
no
business
here
but
olenin
wanted
absolutely
to
see
the
abreks
from
behind
the
mound
he
saw
caps
and
muskets
some
two
hundred
paces
off
suddenly
a
little
cloud
of
smoke
appeared
from
thence
and
again
a
bullet
whistled
past
the
abreks
were
hiding
in
a
marsh
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
olenin
was
much
impressed
by
the
place
in
which
they
sat
in
reality
it
was
very
much
like
the
rest
of
the
steppe
but
because
the
abreks
sat
there
it
seemed
to
detach
itself
from
all
the
rest
and
to
have
become
distinguished
indeed
it
appeared
to
olenin
that
it
was
the
very
spot
for
abreks
to
occupy
lukashka
went
back
to
his
horse
and
olenin
followed
him
must
get
a
said
lukashka
they
will
be
killing
some
of
us
there
behind
that
mound
is
a
nogay
cart
with
a
load
of
hay
the
cornet
listened
to
him
and
the
corporal
agreed
the
cart
of
hay
was
fetched
and
the
cossacks
hiding
behind
it
pushed
it
forward
olenin
rode
up
a
hillock
from
whence
he
could
see
everything
the
moved
on
and
the
cossacks
crowded
together
behind
it
the
cossacks
advanced
but
the
chechens
of
whom
there
were
nine
sat
with
their
knees
in
a
row
and
did
not
fire
all
was
quiet
suddenly
from
the
chechens
arose
the
sound
of
a
mournful
song
something
like
daddy
eroshka
day
dalalay
the
chechens
knew
that
they
could
not
escape
and
to
prevent
themselves
from
being
tempted
to
take
to
flight
they
had
strapped
themselves
together
knee
to
knee
had
got
their
guns
ready
and
were
singing
their
the
cossacks
with
their
drew
closer
and
closer
and
olenin
expected
the
firing
to
begin
at
any
moment
but
the
silence
was
only
broken
by
the
abreks
mournful
song
suddenly
the
song
ceased
there
was
a
sharp
report
a
bullet
struck
the
front
of
the
cart
and
chechen
curses
and
yells
broke
the
silence
and
shot
followed
on
shot
and
one
bullet
after
another
struck
the
cart
the
cossacks
did
not
fire
and
were
now
only
five
paces
distant
another
moment
passed
and
the
cossacks
with
a
whoop
rushed
out
on
both
sides
from
behind
the
cart
lukashka
in
front
of
them
olenin
heard
only
a
few
shots
then
shouting
and
moans
he
thought
he
saw
smoke
and
blood
and
abandoning
his
horse
and
quite
beside
himself
he
ran
towards
the
cossacks
horror
seemed
to
blind
him
he
could
not
make
out
anything
but
understood
that
all
was
over
lukashka
pale
as
death
was
holding
a
wounded
chechen
by
the
arms
and
shouting
kill
him
i
take
him
alive
the
chechen
was
the
man
who
had
fetched
his
brother
body
away
after
lukashka
had
killed
him
lukashka
was
twisting
his
arms
suddenly
the
chechen
wrenched
himself
free
and
fired
his
pistol
lukashka
fell
and
blood
began
to
flow
from
his
stomach
he
jumped
up
but
fell
again
swearing
in
russian
and
in
tartar
more
and
more
blood
appeared
on
his
clothes
and
under
him
some
cossacks
approached
him
and
began
loosening
his
girdle
one
of
them
nazarka
before
beginning
to
help
fumbled
for
some
time
unable
to
put
his
sword
in
its
sheath
it
would
not
go
the
right
way
the
blade
of
the
sword
was
the
chechens
with
their
red
hair
and
clipped
moustaches
lay
dead
and
hacked
about
only
the
one
we
know
of
who
had
fired
at
lukashka
though
wounded
in
many
places
was
still
alive
like
a
wounded
hawk
all
covered
with
blood
blood
was
flowing
from
a
wound
under
his
right
eye
pale
and
gloomy
he
looked
about
him
with
wide
open
excited
eyes
and
clenched
teeth
as
he
crouched
dagger
in
hand
still
prepared
to
defend
himself
the
cornet
went
up
to
him
as
if
intending
to
pass
by
and
with
a
quick
movement
shot
him
in
the
ear
the
chechen
started
up
but
it
was
too
late
and
he
fell
the
cossacks
quite
out
of
breath
dragged
the
bodies
aside
and
took
the
weapons
from
them
each
of
the
chechens
had
been
a
man
and
each
one
had
his
own
individual
expression
lukashka
was
carried
to
the
cart
he
continued
to
swear
in
russian
and
in
tartar
fear
i
strangle
him
with
my
hands
anna
seni
he
cried
struggling
but
he
soon
became
quiet
from
weakness
olenin
rode
home
in
the
evening
he
was
told
that
lukashka
was
at
death
door
but
that
a
tartar
from
beyond
the
river
had
undertaken
to
cure
him
with
herbs
the
bodies
were
brought
to
the
village
office
the
women
and
the
little
boys
hastened
to
look
at
them
it
was
growing
dark
when
olenin
returned
and
he
could
not
collect
himself
after
what
he
had
seen
but
towards
night
memories
of
the
evening
before
came
rushing
to
his
mind
he
looked
out
of
the
window
maryanka
was
passing
to
and
fro
from
the
house
to
the
cowshed
putting
things
straight
her
mother
had
gone
to
the
vineyard
and
her
father
to
the
office
olenin
could
not
wait
till
she
had
quite
finished
her
work
but
went
out
to
meet
her
she
was
in
the
hut
standing
with
her
back
towards
him
olenin
thought
she
felt
shy
said
he
say
maryanka
may
i
come
in
she
suddenly
turned
there
was
a
scarcely
perceptible
trace
of
tears
in
her
eyes
and
her
face
was
beautiful
in
its
sadness
she
looked
at
him
in
silent
dignity
olenin
again
said
i
have
come
me
alone
she
said
her
face
did
not
change
but
the
tears
ran
down
her
cheeks
are
you
crying
for
what
is
it
she
repeated
in
a
rough
voice
have
been
killed
that
what
for
said
olenin
away
what
do
you
want
said
olenin
approaching
her
will
never
get
anything
from
me
do
speak
like
that
olenin
entreated
away
i
sick
of
you
shouted
the
girl
stamping
her
foot
and
moved
threateningly
towards
him
and
her
face
expressed
such
abhorrence
such
contempt
and
such
anger
that
olenin
suddenly
understood
that
there
was
no
hope
for
him
and
that
his
first
impression
of
this
woman
inaccessibility
had
been
perfectly
correct
olenin
said
nothing
more
but
ran
out
of
the
hut
chapter
xlii
for
two
hours
after
returning
home
he
lay
on
his
bed
motionless
then
he
went
to
his
company
commander
and
obtained
leave
to
visit
the
staff
without
taking
leave
of
anyone
and
sending
vanyusha
to
settle
his
accounts
with
his
landlord
he
prepared
to
leave
for
the
fort
where
his
regiment
was
stationed
daddy
eroshka
was
the
only
one
to
see
him
off
they
had
a
drink
and
then
a
second
and
then
yet
another
again
as
on
the
night
of
his
departure
from
moscow
a
conveyance
stood
waiting
at
the
door
but
olenin
did
not
confer
with
himself
as
he
had
done
then
and
did
not
say
to
himself
that
all
he
had
thought
and
done
here
was
it
he
did
not
promise
himself
a
new
life
he
loved
maryanka
more
than
ever
and
knew
that
he
could
never
be
loved
by
her
my
lad
said
daddy
eroshka
you
go
on
an
expedition
be
wise
and
listen
to
my
words
the
words
of
an
old
man
when
you
are
out
on
a
raid
or
the
like
you
know
i
an
old
wolf
and
have
seen
things
and
when
they
begin
firing
do
get
into
a
crowd
where
there
are
many
men
when
you
fellows
get
frightened
you
always
try
to
get
close
together
with
a
lot
of
others
you
think
it
is
merrier
to
be
with
others
but
that
where
it
is
worst
of
all
they
always
aim
at
a
crowd
now
i
used
to
keep
farther
away
from
the
others
and
went
alone
and
i
never
been
wounded
yet
what
things
have
i
seen
in
my
day
you
got
a
bullet
in
your
back
remarked
vanyusha
who
was
clearing
up
the
room
was
the
cossacks
fooling
about
answered
eroshka
how
was
that
asked
olenin
just
so
we
were
drinking
vanka
sitkin
one
of
the
cossacks
got
merry
and
puff
he
gave
me
one
from
his
pistol
just
here
and
did
it
hurt
asked
olenin
will
you
soon
be
ready
he
added
where
the
hurry
let
me
tell
you
when
he
banged
into
me
the
bullet
did
not
break
the
bone
but
remained
here
and
i
say
killed
me
brother
eh
what
have
you
done
to
me
i
wo
let
you
off
you
have
to
stand
me
a
pailful
but
did
it
hurt
olenin
asked
again
scarcely
listening
to
the
tale
me
finish
he
stood
a
pailful
and
we
drank
it
but
the
blood
went
on
flowing
the
whole
room
was
drenched
and
covered
with
blood
grandad
burlak
he
says
the
lad
will
give
up
the
ghost
stand
a
bottle
of
the
sweet
sort
or
we
shall
have
you
taken
up
they
bought
more
drink
and
boozed
and
boozed
but
did
it
hurt
you
much
olenin
asked
once
more
indeed
do
interrupt
i
do
like
it
let
me
finish
we
boozed
and
boozed
till
morning
and
i
fell
asleep
on
the
top
of
the
oven
drunk
when
i
woke
in
the
morning
i
could
not
unbend
myself
anyhow
it
very
painful
repeated
olenin
thinking
that
now
he
would
at
last
get
an
answer
to
his
question
i
tell
you
it
was
painful
i
did
not
say
it
was
painful
but
i
could
not
bend
and
could
not
walk
then
it
healed
up
said
olenin
not
even
laughing
so
heavy
was
his
heart
healed
up
but
the
bullet
is
still
there
just
feel
it
and
lifting
his
shirt
he
showed
his
powerful
back
where
just
near
the
bone
a
bullet
could
be
felt
and
rolled
about
how
it
rolls
he
said
evidently
amusing
himself
with
the
bullet
as
with
a
toy
now
it
has
rolled
to
the
back

agreed
only
too
fully
that
all
was
humbug
in
the
world
in
which
he
had
lived
and
to
which
he
was

asked

as
if
he
were
dead
he
does
not
eat
nor
drink
vodka
is
the
only
thing
his
soul
accepts
but
as
long
as
he
drinks
vodka
well
i
be
sorry
to
lose
the
lad
a
fine
lad
a
brave
like
me
i
too
lay
dying
like
that
once
the
old
women
were
already
wailing
my
head
was
burning
they
had
already
laid
me
out
under
the
holy
icons
so
i
lay
there
and
above
me
on
the
oven
little
drummers
no
bigger
than
this
beat
the
tattoo
i
shout
at
them
and
they
drum
all
the
harder
the
old
man
laughed
women
brought
our
church
elder
they
were
getting
ready
to
bury
me
they
said
he
defiled
himself
with
worldly
unbelievers
he
made
merry
with
women
he
ruined
people
he
did
not
fast
and
he
played
the
balalayka
confess
they
said
so
i
began
to
confess
i
sinned
i
said
whatever
the
priest
said
i
always
answered
i
sinned
he
began
to
ask
me
about
the
balalayka
where
is
the
accursed
thing
he
says
show
it
me
and
smash
it
but
i
say
i
not
got
it
i
hidden
it
myself
in
a
net
in
the
outhouse
i
knew
they
could
not
find
it
so
they
left
me
yet
after
all
i
recovered
when
i
went
for
my
balalayka
what
was
i
saying
he
continued
to
me
and
keep
farther
away
from
the
other
men
or
you
get
killed
foolishly
i
feel
for
you
truly
you
are
a
drinker
i
love
you
and
fellows
like
you
like
riding
up
the
mounds
there
was
one
who
lived
here
who
had
come
from
russia
he
always
would
ride
up
the
mounds
he
called
the
mounds
so
funnily
hillocks
whenever
he
saw
a
mound
off
he
gallop
once
he
galloped
off
that
way
and
rode
to
the
top
quite
pleased
but
a
chechen
fired
at
him
and
killed
him
ah
how
well
they
shoot
from
their
those
chechens
some
of
them
shoot
even
better
than
i
do
i
do
like
it
when
a
fellow
gets
killed
so
foolishly
sometimes
i
used
to
look
at
your
soldiers
and
wonder
at
them
there
foolishness
for
you
they
go
the
poor
fellows
all
in
a
clump
and
even
sew
red
collars
to
their
coats
how
can
they
help
being
hit
one
gets
killed
they
drag
him
away
and
another
takes
his
place
what
foolishness
the
old
man
repeated
shaking
his
head
not
scatter
and
go
one
by
one
so
you
just
go
like
that
and
they
wo
notice
you
that
what
you
must
do
thank
you
daddy
god
willing

may
meet

said
olenin
getting
up
and
moving
towards
the
passage
the
old
man
who
was
sitting
on
the
floor
did
not
rise
that
the
way
one
says
fool

he
began

said
olenin
again
the
old
man
rose
and
held
out
his
hand
olenin
pressed
it
and
turned
to
go

your
mug
your
mug
and
the
old
man
took
olenin
by
the
head
with
both
hands
and
kissed
him
three
times
with
wet
moustaches
and
lips
and
began
to
cry

into
the
cart

said
the
old
man
sobbing
quite
sincerely
olenin
got
out
a
musket
and
gave
it
to
him
a
lot

given
the
old
fellow
murmured
vanyusha
never
have
enough
a
regular
old
beggar
they
are
all
such
irregular
people
he
remarked
as
he
wrapped
himself
in
his
overcoat
and
took
his
seat
on
the
box
your
tongue
swine
exclaimed
the
old
man
laughing
a
stingy
fellow
maryanka
came
out
of
the
cowshed
glanced
indifferently
at
the
cart
bowed
and
went
towards
the
hut
fille
said
vanyusha
with
a
wink
and
burst
out
into
a
silly
laugh
on
shouted
olenin
angrily
my
lad
i
wo

shouted
eroshka
olenin
turned
round
daddy
eroshka
was
talking
to
maryanka
evidently
about
his
own
affairs
and
neither
the
old
man
nor
the
girl
looked
at
olenin
the
end
